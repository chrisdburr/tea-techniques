      "description": "Contextual Decomposition explains LSTM and RNN predictions by decomposing the final hidden state into contributions from individual inputs and their interactions. Unlike simpler attribution methods, it separates the direct contribution of specific words or phrases from the contextual effects of surrounding words. This is particularly useful for understanding how sequential models process language, as it can identify whether a word's influence comes from its individual meaning or from its interaction with nearby words in the sequence.",

This technique analyses these traditional attention patterns, particularly in encoder-decoder architectures and sequence-to-sequence models, where attention weights reveal which source elements influence each output step. Unlike transformer self-attention analysis, this focuses on understanding alignment patterns, temporal dependencies, and encoder-decoder attention dynamics in classical neural architectures.",
