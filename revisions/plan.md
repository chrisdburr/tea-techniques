# TEA Techniques Refactoring Plan Checklist

## Overall Goal & Summary

This comprehensive refactoring plan aims to transform the TEA Techniques application into a robust, maintainable, and feature-complete platform for managing AI assurance techniques. The project currently faces several critical issues, including database inconsistencies, disabled core functionality, and technical debt in both frontend and backend implementations.

The plan is structured in six stages, starting with critical stabilization of the database and core functionality, progressing through architectural improvements in both frontend and backend, enhancing test coverage and error handling, and concluding with documentation and deployment refinements. Each task is assigned a priority level and includes detailed implementation steps to guide developers through the refactoring process. By following this plan, the application will achieve greater stability, improved code quality, better user experience, and enhanced maintainability.
