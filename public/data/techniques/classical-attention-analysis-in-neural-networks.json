  "description": "Classical attention mechanisms in RNNs and CNNs create alignment matrices and temporal attention patterns that show how models focus on different input elements over time or space. This technique analyses these traditional attention patterns, particularly in encoder-decoder architectures and sequence-to-sequence models, where attention weights reveal which source elements influence each output step. Unlike transformer self-attention analysis, this focuses on understanding alignment patterns, temporal dependencies, and encoder-decoder attention dynamics in classical neural architectures.",
