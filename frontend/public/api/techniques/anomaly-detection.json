  "description": "Anomaly detection identifies unusual behaviours, inputs, or outputs that deviate significantly from established normal patterns using statistical, machine learning, or rule-based methods. Applied to AI/ML systems, it serves as a continuous monitoring mechanism that can flag unexpected model predictions, suspicious input patterns, data drift, adversarial attacks, or operational malfunctions. By establishing baselines of normal system behaviour and alerting when deviations exceed predefined thresholds, organisations can detect potential security threats, model degradation, fairness violations, or system failures before they cause significant harm.",
