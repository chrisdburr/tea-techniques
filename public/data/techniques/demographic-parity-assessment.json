  "description": "Demographic Parity Assessment evaluates whether a model produces equal positive prediction rates across different demographic groups, regardless of underlying differences in qualifications or base rates. It quantifies fairness using metrics like Statistical Parity Difference (the absolute difference in positive outcome rates between groups) or Disparate Impact ratio (the ratio of positive rates). Unlike techniques that modify data or models, this is purely a measurement approach that highlights when protected groups receive favourable outcomes at different rates, helping organisations identify and document potential discrimination.",
