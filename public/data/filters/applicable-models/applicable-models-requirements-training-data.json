For example, in a dataset of customer transactions, prototypes might be the most representative buying patterns (frequent small purchases, occasional large purchases), whilst criticisms could be unusual behaviors (bulk buyers, one-time high-value customers). This dual approach reveals both what is normal and what is exceptional, helping understand data coverage and model blind spots.",

The technique encompasses various approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), statistical sampling methods, and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy. Beyond privacy protection, synthetic data serves multiple purposes: augmenting limited datasets, balancing class distributions, testing model robustness, enabling data sharing across organisations, and supporting fairness assessments by generating representative samples for underrepresented groups.",

By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features.
