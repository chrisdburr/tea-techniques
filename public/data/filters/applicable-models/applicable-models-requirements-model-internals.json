This technique analyses these traditional attention patterns, particularly in encoder-decoder architectures and sequence-to-sequence models, where attention weights reveal which source elements influence each output step. Unlike transformer self-attention analysis, this focuses on understanding alignment patterns, temporal dependencies, and encoder-decoder attention dynamics in classical neural architectures.",

The method consists of a predictor network that learns the main task whilst an adversarial discriminator network simultaneously attempts to predict sensitive attributes from the predictor's hidden representations. Through this adversarial min-max game, the predictor is incentivised to learn features that are informative for the task but statistically independent of protected attributes, effectively removing bias at the representation level in deep learning models.",
