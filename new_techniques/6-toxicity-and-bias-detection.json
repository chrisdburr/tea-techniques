  "name": "Toxicity and Bias Detection",
  "description": "Toxicity and bias detection uses automated tools and human review to identify harmful, offensive, or biased content in model outputs. This technique employs classifiers trained to detect toxic language, hate speech, stereotypes, and demographic biases, combined with targeted testing using adversarial prompts designed to elicit problematic responses. Detection covers explicit toxicity (direct slurs, threats), implicit bias (subtle stereotyping), and distributional unfairness (differential treatment of demographic groups).",

      "description": "Context-dependent nature of toxicity makes automated detection challenging, as the same phrase may be harmful or harmless depending on usage context."
