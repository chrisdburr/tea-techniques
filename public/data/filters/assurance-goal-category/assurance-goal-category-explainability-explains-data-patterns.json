The technique works by varying the selected feature(s) across their full range whilst keeping all other features fixed at their original values, then averaging the predictions. This creates a clear visualisation of whether increasing or decreasing a feature tends to increase or decrease predictions, and reveals patterns like linear trends, plateaus, or threshold effects that help explain model behaviour.",

It works by analysing how variables relate to each other, finding a smaller number of unobserved factors that explain patterns among multiple observed variables. Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

Unlike t-SNE, UMAP preserves both local neighbourhood relationships and global topology more effectively, using techniques from topological data analysis and Riemannian geometry. This approach often produces more interpretable cluster layouts while maintaining meaningful distances between clusters, making it particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex dataset structures.",

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",
