  "name": "Model Behavioral Cloning Detection",
  "description": "Model behavioral cloning detection identifies whether a model's behavior has been replicated by an unauthorized third party through knowledge distillation or imitation learning. This technique uses fingerprinting methods that embed detectable signatures in model outputs, statistical testing to identify suspiciously similar prediction patterns, and watermarking schemes that survive the distillation process. Detection enables model owners to prove intellectual property theft and protect proprietary AI systems from unauthorized replication.",
