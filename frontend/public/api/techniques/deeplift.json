  "description": "DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) explains neural network predictions by decomposing the difference between the actual output and a reference output back to individual input features. It compares each neuron's activation to a reference activation (typically from a baseline input like all zeros or the dataset mean) and propagates these differences backwards through the network using chain rule modifications. Unlike gradient-based methods, DeepLIFT satisfies the sensitivity property (zero input gets zero attribution) and provides more stable attributions by using discrete differences rather than gradients.",
