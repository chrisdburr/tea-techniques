It enhances detection by applying temperature scaling to soften the model's output distribution and adding small, carefully calibrated perturbations to the input that push in-distribution samples towards higher confidence predictions. By measuring the maximum softmax probability after these adjustments, ODIN can effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs, flagging potentially unreliable predictions before they cause downstream errors.",

By training several models on the same data with different starting points, the ensemble reveals how much the model's predictions depend on training randomness. The disagreement between ensemble members naturally indicates prediction uncertainty - when models agree, confidence is high; when they disagree, uncertainty is revealed. This approach provides more reliable uncertainty estimates, better out-of-distribution detection, and improved calibration compared to single models.",

The student learns from the teacher's soft predictions and intermediate representations rather than just hard labels, capturing nuanced decision boundaries and uncertainty. This produces models that are faster, require less memory, and are often more interpretable whilst maintaining much of the original performance. Beyond compression, distillation can improve model reliability by regularising training and enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

      "name": "Causal Mediation Analysis in Language Models",
      "description": "Causal mediation analysis in language models is a mechanistic interpretability technique that systematically investigates how specific internal components (neurons, attention heads, or layers) causally contribute to model outputs. By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",

This technique computes gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input (typically all-zeros, padding tokens, or neutral text) to the actual input, integrating these gradients to obtain attribution scores. Unlike vanilla gradient methods, Integrated Gradients satisfies axioms of sensitivity and implementation invariance, making it particularly valuable for understanding transformer-based language models where token interactions are complex.",
