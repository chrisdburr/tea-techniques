This path integral ensures that the attributions satisfy fundamental axioms like completeness (attributions sum up to the difference between the prediction and the baseline prediction) and sensitivity (non-zero attributions for features that change the prediction).

When a model is too confident in its wrong answers, temperature scaling can fix this by making the predictions more realistic. It works by dividing the model's outputs by the temperature value before converting them to probabilities. Higher temperatures make the model less confident, whilst lower temperatures increase confidence. The technique maintains the model's accuracy whilst ensuring that when it says it's 90% confident, it's actually right about 90% of the time.",

The method consists of a predictor network that learns the main task whilst an adversarial discriminator network simultaneously attempts to predict sensitive attributes from the predictor's hidden representations. Through this adversarial min-max game, the predictor is incentivised to learn features that are informative for the task but statistically independent of protected attributes, effectively removing bias at the representation level in deep learning models.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features.
