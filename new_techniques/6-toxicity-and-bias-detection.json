  "name": "Toxicity and Bias Detection",
  "description": "Toxicity and bias detection uses automated classifiers and human review to identify harmful, offensive, or biased content in model outputs. This technique employs tools trained to detect toxic language, hate speech, stereotypes, and demographic biases through targeted testing with adversarial prompts. Detection covers explicit toxicity, implicit bias, and distributional unfairness across demographic groups.",

      "description": "Toxicity classifiers themselves may have biases, potentially flagging legitimate discussions of sensitive topics or minority language patterns as toxic."

      "description": "Context-dependent nature of toxicity makes automated detection challenging, as the same phrase may be harmful or harmless depending on usage context."

      "description": "Evolving language and cultural differences mean toxicity definitions change over time and vary across communities, requiring constant updating."
