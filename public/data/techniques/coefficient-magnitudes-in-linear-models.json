  "description": "Coefficient Magnitudes assess feature influence in linear models by examining the absolute values of their coefficients. Features with larger absolute coefficients are considered to have a stronger impact on the prediction, while the sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of that influence (positive or negative). This technique provides a straightforward and transparent way to understand the direct linear relationship between each input feature and the model's output.",
