  "description": "MLflow is an open-source platform that tracks machine learning experiments by automatically logging parameters, metrics, models, and artifacts throughout the ML lifecycle. It provides a centralised repository for comparing different experimental runs, reproducing results, and managing model versions. Teams can track hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, model files, and execution environment details, creating a comprehensive audit trail that supports collaboration, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance across the entire machine learning development process.",
