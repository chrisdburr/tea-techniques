<Callout variant="info" title="About">
  This document outlines the criteria used to evaluate and select techniques for inclusion in the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Techniques database (`techniques.json`). The goal is to create a curated, high-quality resource that helps practitioners build robust assurance cases for their AI systems.
</Callout>

## What is a "Technique" in this Context

A **technique** refers to a specific method, tool or approach used to generate a tangible evidential artefact (e.g. metric, documentation, report).
In the present context, these techniques are all directed towards evidencing the validity of assurance claims related to goals such as explainability, fairness, privacy, security, safety, and more.

The evidence produced by applying these techniques is intended to be used within an assurance case to support claims about the system's trustworthiness and ethical credentials.
Techniques can range from statistical tests and algorithms (e.g. LIME or SHAP), to documentation standards (e.g. Model Cards), and organisational processes (e.g. Red Teaming).

<Callout variant="info" title="Conceptual Distinctions">
It is helpful to distinguish the following concepts:

- **Principles:** foundational concepts (e.g., fair outcomes, explainable predictions) that serve as goals to achieve.
- **Specific Techniques or Implementations of Principles:** concrete methods used to measure, achieve, or provide evidence for principles (e.g., statistical parity difference as a metric for group fairness, DP-SGD as a technique to achieve privacy). The database primarily focuses on these specific, actionable techniques.
- **Methods or processes:** broad approaches (e.g., "fairness-aware preprocessing") that may be served by multiple specific techniques.

The TEA techniques covers all three of these categories.

## Criteria for Inclusion in the TEA Techniques Database

Before we accept or add a new technique to the database, we assess it against the following criteria:

1. **Relevance to Assurance Goals:**

- Does the technique directly address _one or more_ principles?
- Can the output of the technique serve as credible evidence for specific assurance claims related to these goals?

2. **Nature of Evidence Provided:**

- What kind of output does the technique produce (e.g., quantitative metrics, statistical tests, visualisations, counterfactual examples, formal proofs, qualitative reports)?
- How does this output support a broader argument within an assurance case?

3. **Applicability & Scope:**
   - **Model Dependency:** Is it model-agnostic or specific to certain architectures (e.g., neural networks, decision trees)?
   - **Data Type:** Is it applicable to specific data types (e.g. tabular, text, images, time series)?
   - **Lifecycle Stage:** At which stage of a project's lifecycle would the technique typically be applied (e.g. project design, data preprocessing, model training, system deployment, monitoring)?
   - **Scope of Explanation:** Does the technique provide local (instance-level) or global (model-level) insights?

4. **Maturity and Validity:**

- Is the technique well-established in research or practice? Is it peer-reviewed?
- Is there empirical or theoretical evidence supporting its effectiveness and validity for its stated purpose?
- Are its underlying assumptions clearly understood?

5. **Practicality & Resource Requirements:**
   - **Complexity and Expertise Needed:** How difficult is it to understand and implement?
   - **Computational Cost:** How resource-intensive is it to run? Does it scale?
   - **Data Requirements:** Does it have specific requirements regarding data size, format, or labelling?

6. **Interpretability & Actionability:**

- How easy is it for different stakeholders (developers, auditors, regulators) to understand the technique's output?
- Can the results be readily translated into actionable steps or specific claims in an assurance case?
- Are the limitations, constraints, and underlying assumptions well-documented?
- Are there readily available software libraries, implementations, or detailed tutorials?

### Why Have Evaluation Criteria

Having clear, well-defined criteria for inclusion in the TEA Techniques dataset serves several crucial purposes:

1. **Quality Control:** Ensures that the techniques listed are relevant, credible, and useful for building assurance cases in the [TEA Platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net).
2. **Consistency:** Provides a standardised framework for evaluating diverse techniques, leading to a more coherent and useful dataset.
3. **Scope Management:** Helps define the boundaries of the dataset, preventing the inclusion of irrelevant or poorly defined methods.
4. **User Trust:** Builds confidence for users that the techniques presented have met a certain standard of relevance and utility for TEA purposes.
5. **Contribution Guidance:** Offers clear guidelines for community members who wish to suggest new techniques for inclusion.
