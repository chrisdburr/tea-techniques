  "name": "Few-Shot Fairness Evaluation",
  "description": "Few-shot fairness evaluation assesses whether in-context learning with few-shot examples introduces or amplifies biases in model predictions. This technique systematically varies demographic characteristics in few-shot examples and measures how these variations affect model outputs for different groups. Evaluation includes testing prompt sensitivity (how example selection impacts fairness), stereotype amplification (whether biased examples disproportionately affect outputs), and consistency (whether similar inputs receive equitable treatment regardless of example composition).",
