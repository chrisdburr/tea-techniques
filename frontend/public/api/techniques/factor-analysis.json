  "description": "Factor analysis is a statistical technique that identifies latent variables (hidden factors) underlying observed correlations in data. It works by analysing how variables relate to each other, finding a smaller number of unobserved factors that explain patterns among multiple observed variables. Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",
