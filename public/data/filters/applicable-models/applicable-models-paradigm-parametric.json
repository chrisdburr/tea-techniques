It works by accumulating gradients along a straight path from a user-defined baseline input (e.g., a black image or an all-zero vector) to the actual input. This path integral ensures that the attributions satisfy fundamental axioms like completeness (attributions sum up to the difference between the prediction and the baseline prediction) and sensitivity (non-zero attributions for features that change the prediction). The output is a set of importance scores, often visualised as heatmaps, indicating which parts of the input were most influential for the model's decision.",

This technique reveals how input features affect different parts of the outcome distribution - perhaps property size strongly influences luxury homes (90th percentile) but barely affects budget properties (10th percentile). By capturing the full conditional distribution, quantile regression provides rich uncertainty information and enables robust prediction intervals.",

The student learns from the teacher's soft predictions and intermediate representations rather than just hard labels, capturing nuanced decision boundaries and uncertainty. This produces models that are faster, require less memory, and are often more interpretable whilst maintaining much of the original performance. Beyond compression, distillation can improve model reliability by regularising training and enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.",
