      "description": "Integrated Gradients is an attribution technique that explains a model's prediction by quantifying the contribution of each input feature. It works by accumulating gradients along a straight path from a user-defined baseline input (e.g., a black image or an all-zero vector) to the actual input. This path integral ensures that the attributions satisfy fundamental axioms like completeness (attributions sum up to the difference between the prediction and the baseline prediction) and sensitivity (non-zero attributions for features that change the prediction). The output is a set of importance scores, often visualised as heatmaps, indicating which parts of the input were most influential for the model's decision.",

It compares each neuron's activation to a reference activation (typically from a baseline input like all zeros or the dataset mean) and propagates these differences backwards through the network using chain rule modifications. Unlike gradient-based methods, DeepLIFT satisfies the sensitivity property (zero input gets zero attribution) and provides more stable attributions by using discrete differences rather than gradients.",
