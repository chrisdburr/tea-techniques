# Comprehensive Test Implementation Plan with Refactoring

## Overview

This plan implements comprehensive test coverage for the TEA Techniques project. Based on codebase analysis, several components are overly complex and need refactoring before testing to ensure we're testing clean, maintainable code rather than cementing poor patterns.

## Critical Complexity Issues Identified

### Backend Complexity Issues (Must Refactor First):

1. **TechniqueSerializer** (318 lines) - `create()` and `update()` methods are 80+ lines each
2. **import_techniques.py** (424 lines) - `_process_technique()` method is 150+ lines
3. **debug_endpoint** (95+ lines) - Multiple responsibilities in single function

### Frontend Complexity Issues (Must Refactor First):

1. **TechniqueForm.tsx** (850 lines) - Extremely complex component with multiple responsibilities
2. Other components are reasonably sized
