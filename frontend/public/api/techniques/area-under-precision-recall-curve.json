  "description": "Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) measures model performance by plotting precision (the proportion of positive predictions that are correct) against recall (the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified) at various classification thresholds, then calculating the area under the resulting curve. Unlike accuracy or AUC-ROC, AUPRC is particularly valuable for imbalanced datasets where the minority class is of primary interest---a perfect score is 1.0, whilst random performance equals the positive class proportion. By focusing on the precision-recall trade-off, it provides a more informative assessment than overall accuracy for scenarios where false positives and false negatives have different costs, especially when positive examples are rare.",
