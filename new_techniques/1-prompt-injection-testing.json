  "name": "Prompt Injection Testing",
  "description": "Prompt injection testing systematically evaluates LLMs and generative AI systems for vulnerabilities where malicious users can override system instructions through carefully crafted inputs. This technique involves testing various injection patterns including direct instruction manipulation, context confusion, role-playing exploits, and delimiter attacks. Testers attempt to make models ignore safety guidelines, leak system prompts, or perform unauthorized actions by embedding adversarial instructions within user inputs.",
