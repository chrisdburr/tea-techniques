Features with larger absolute coefficients are considered to have a stronger impact on the prediction, while the sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of that influence (positive or negative). This technique provides a straightforward and transparent way to understand the direct linear relationship between each input feature and the model's output.",

Each feature's effect is modelled separately as a smooth function, visualised as a curve showing how the feature influences predictions across its range. GAMs achieve this through spline functions or other smoothing techniques that capture complex patterns in individual variables without interactions, making them particularly valuable for domains requiring both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.",
