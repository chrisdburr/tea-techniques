  "name": "API Usage Pattern Monitoring",
  "description": "API usage pattern monitoring analyzes how AI model APIs are being used in production to detect anomalies, abuse, and emerging risks. This technique tracks request patterns, input distributions, error rates, and usage velocity to identify potential model extraction attempts, adversarial probing, automated abuse, or unexpected deployment contexts. Monitoring enables real-time threat detection, informs model improvement priorities, and provides visibility into how systems are actually being used versus intended use cases.",
