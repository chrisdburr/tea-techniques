      "description": "Causal mediation analysis in language models is a mechanistic interpretability technique that systematically investigates how specific internal components (neurons, attention heads, or layers) causally contribute to model outputs. By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",

Unlike general counterfactual fairness, this approach enables practitioners to identify and intervene on particular causal paths that may introduce bias whilst preserving other legitimate pathways. The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
