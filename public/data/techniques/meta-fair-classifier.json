  "name": "Meta Fair Classifier",
  "description": "An in-processing fairness technique that employs meta-learning to modify any existing classifier for optimising fairness metrics whilst maintaining predictive performance. The method learns how to adjust model parameters or decision boundaries to satisfy fairness constraints such as demographic parity or equalised odds through iterative optimisation. This approach is particularly valuable when retrofitting fairness to pre-trained models that perform well but exhibit bias, as it can incorporate fairness without requiring complete retraining from scratch.",
