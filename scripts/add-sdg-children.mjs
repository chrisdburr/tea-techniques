      'Generates synthetic tabular datasets using Generative Adversarial Networks, most commonly through architectures such as CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN) and TVAE (Triplet-based Variational Autoencoder). These models learn the joint distribution of mixed-type columns — continuous, discrete, and categorical — by training a generator and discriminator in an adversarial framework, with mode-specific normalisation to handle multimodal continuous distributions and training-by-sampling to address class imbalance. The resulting synthetic tables aim to preserve statistical relationships, correlations, and marginal distributions of the original data whilst containing no real records, supporting privacy-preserving data sharing, model development on sensitive datasets, and augmentation of limited training data.',

The foundational method, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), creates new instances by interpolating between existing minority samples and their k-nearest neighbours. Extensions include Borderline-SMOTE (focusing generation near decision boundaries), ADASYN (adaptively weighting harder-to-learn instances), and SVMSMOTE (using support vectors to guide generation). These methods operate directly on feature vectors without requiring neural network training, making them computationally lightweight and applicable to any tabular classification task.',
