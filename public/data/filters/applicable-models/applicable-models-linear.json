      "description": "Intrinsically interpretable models are machine learning algorithms that are transparent by design, allowing users to understand their decision-making process without requiring additional explanation techniques. This category includes decision trees and rule lists (which use if-then logic), linear and logistic regression models (which use weighted feature combinations), and other simple algorithms where the model structure itself provides interpretability. These models prioritise transparency over complexity, making them ideal when stakeholder understanding and regulatory compliance are paramount.",
