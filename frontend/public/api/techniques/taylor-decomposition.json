  "description": "Taylor Decomposition is a mathematical technique that explains neural network predictions by computing first-order and higher-order derivatives of the network's output with respect to input features. It decomposes the prediction into relevance scores that indicate how much each input feature and feature interaction contributes to the final decision. The method uses Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) principles to trace prediction contributions backwards through the network layers, providing precise mathematical attributions for each input element.",
