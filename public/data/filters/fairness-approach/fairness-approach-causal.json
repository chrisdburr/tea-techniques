      "description": "Counterfactual Fairness Assessment evaluates whether a model's predictions would remain unchanged if an individual's protected attributes (race, gender, age) were different, whilst keeping all other causally legitimate factors constant. The technique requires constructing a causal graph that maps relationships between variables, then using do-calculus or structural causal models to simulate counterfactual scenarios. For example, it asks: 'Would this loan application still be approved if the applicant were a different race, holding constant their actual qualifications and economic circumstances?' This individual-level fairness criterion helps identify when decisions depend improperly on protected characteristics.",

      "description": "A causal fairness evaluation technique that assesses algorithmic discrimination by examining specific causal pathways in a model's decision-making process. Unlike general counterfactual fairness, this approach enables practitioners to identify and intervene on particular causal paths that may introduce bias whilst preserving other legitimate pathways. The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
