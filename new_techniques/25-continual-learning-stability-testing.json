  "name": "Continual Learning Stability Testing",
  "description": "Continual learning stability testing evaluates whether models that learn from streaming data maintain performance on previously learned tasks while acquiring new capabilities. This technique measures catastrophic forgetting (performance degradation on old tasks), forward transfer (whether old knowledge helps new learning), and backward transfer (whether new learning damages old performance). Testing includes challenging scenarios where data distributions shift significantly and evaluates whether stability techniques like experience replay or regularization effectively preserve knowledge.",

      "description": "Comprehensive testing requires maintaining evaluation datasets for all previously learned tasks, which becomes burdensome as systems learn continuously."
