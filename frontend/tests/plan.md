# Comprehensive Frontend Test Suite for TEA Techniques

A well-designed test suite for the TEA Techniques web application should systematically validate all frontend components and user flows. Here's a comprehensive testing strategy using Jest and React Testing Library:

## Overview of the Test Suite

I've designed a comprehensive testing strategy for the TEA Techniques web application that systematically tests all frontend components. The test suite provides thorough coverage across different levels of testing to ensure the application functions correctly.

### Key Testing Areas:

1. **Unit Tests** - Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Testing interactions between connected components
3. **API Integration Tests** - Verifying correct data fetching and error handling  
4. **Page Component Tests** - Testing complete page layouts and functionality
5. **End-to-End Tests** - Testing complete user flows (using Cypress/Playwright)

### Testing Stack

The test suite leverages the following tools:

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For mocking API responses
- **Cypress/Playwright**: Recommended for end-to-end testing

## Detailed Breakdown of Tests

### Unit Tests for UI Components

These tests verify that individual UI components render correctly and handle user interactions properly:

- **Button Component**: Testing rendering, click events, variants, and disabled state
- **Card Component**: Testing proper rendering of all card sub-components
- **StarRating Component**: Testing correct number of filled/empty stars
- **Header/Footer Components**: Testing navigation links and responsive behavior

### Integration Tests

These tests check how components interact with each other:

- **TechniquesList & TechniquesSidebar**: Testing that filtering works correctly
- **GoalIcon Component**: Testing that the correct icons are rendered for each assurance goal

### API Integration Tests

These tests ensure the application fetches and handles data correctly:

- **API Hooks Testing**: Verify `useTechniques`, `useTechniqueDetail`, and other hooks fetch data correctly
- **Error Handling**: Test how the application handles API errors

### Page Component Tests

These tests verify that complete pages render correctly:

- **Home Page**: Testing all sections render correctly
- **Technique Detail Page**: Testing rendering of technique details, loading, and error states

### End-to-End Testing

For end-to-end tests, the strategy includes using Cypress or Playwright to test complete user flows:

- Navigating through the application
- Applying filters and verifying results
- Viewing technique details
- Testing pagination
- Testing dark mode functionality

## Implementation Notes

1. The test suite includes comprehensive mocking of:
   - Next.js hooks (`useRouter`, `useParams`)
   - API responses
   - Browser APIs (localStorage, matchMedia)

2. All tests follow best practices for React Testing Library:
   - Testing user-visible behavior, not implementation details
   - Using semantic queries (getByRole, getByText)
   - Simulating real user interactions

3. The tests are organized by component type and functionality, making it easy to:
   - Locate specific tests
   - Maintain the test suite as the application evolves
   - Identify the purpose of each test

## Getting Started with Testing

To run the tests, you would:

1. Install testing dependencies if not already included:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom jest
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. For end-to-end tests with Cypress (after installation):
   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

This comprehensive test suite will ensure that the TEA Techniques web application functions correctly across all components and user flows, providing confidence in the application's reliability.
