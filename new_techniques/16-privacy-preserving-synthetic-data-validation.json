  "name": "Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Validation",
  "description": "Privacy-preserving synthetic data validation assesses whether synthetically generated datasets protect individual privacy while maintaining statistical utility. This technique measures privacy through disclosure risk metrics, re-identification attack success rates, and attribute inference vulnerability testing. Utility is evaluated by comparing statistical properties, machine learning model performance, and analytical conclusions between synthetic and real data. Validation ensures synthetic data provides differential privacy guarantees or empirical privacy protection against realistic attack scenarios.",
