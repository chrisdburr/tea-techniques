This technique reveals how input features affect different parts of the outcome distribution - perhaps property size strongly influences luxury homes (90th percentile) but barely affects budget properties (10th percentile). By capturing the full conditional distribution, quantile regression provides rich uncertainty information and enables robust prediction intervals.",

      "description": "Model distillation transfers knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student) by training the student to mimic the teacher's behaviour. The student learns from the teacher's soft predictions and intermediate representations rather than just hard labels, capturing nuanced decision boundaries and uncertainty. This produces models that are faster, require less memory, and are often more interpretable whilst maintaining much of the original performance. Beyond compression, distillation can improve model reliability by regularising training and enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

      "description": "Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), also known as Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV), identify mathematical directions in neural network representation space that correspond to human-understandable concepts such as 'stripes', 'young', or 'medical equipment'. The technique works by finding linear directions that separate activations of concept examples from non-concept examples, then measuring how much these concept directions influence the model's predictions. This provides quantitative answers to questions like 'How much does the concept of youth affect this model's hiring decisions?' enabling systematic bias detection and model understanding.",

By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features.
