  "description": "Multimodal alignment verification ensures different modalities (vision, language, audio) are synchronized and consistent in multimodal AI systems. This technique tests whether descriptions match content, sounds associate with correct sources, and cross-modal reasoning maintains accuracy. It produces alignment scores, grounding quality metrics, and reports on modality-specific failure patterns.",
