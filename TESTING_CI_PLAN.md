# TEA Techniques - Comprehensive Testing & CI/CD Strategy

## Clean Slate Approach for Production-Ready Quality

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a **comprehensive, maintainable testing strategy** that prioritizes correctness and long-term maintainability over quick wins. We start with a clean slate, removing existing inadequate tests and building a proper foundation that supports robust software development practices.

## Core Principles

1. **Quality Over Speed**: Build it right the first time
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test the critical paths that matter
3. **Maintainable Architecture**: Tests that evolve with the codebase
4. **Real-World Testing**: Prefer integration over heavy mocking
5. **Fast Feedback**: Efficient CI/CD that catches issues early

## Phase 0: Clean Slate Foundation 🗑️

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Remove existing inadequate tests to prevent shortcuts and ensure comprehensive coverage

### Backend Test Removal

- [x] ~~`backend/api/tests/test_management_commands.py`~~ (removed)
- [x] Remove remaining inadequate test files in `backend/api/tests/` (removed test_api.py, test_error_handling.py, test_models.py)
- [x] Clear any test configurations that encourage poor patterns (preserved essential infrastructure only)
- [x] Document what was removed and why (created REMOVED_TESTS_DOCUMENTATION.md)

### Frontend Test Removal

- [x] Delete all existing `*.test.ts` and `*.test.tsx` files (removed entire /tests directory)
- [x] Remove current MSW setup (over-complicated for current needs)
- [x] Clear jest configuration that enables shortcuts (cleaned jest.setup.ts, kept essential Next.js mocks)
- [x] Document existing test gaps for reference (documented in REMOVED_TESTS_DOCUMENTATION.md)

### Benefits of Clean Slate

- Forces proper test architecture from the start
- Prevents "good enough" mindset that leads to technical debt
- Ensures consistent testing patterns across the codebase
- Eliminates confusion between old and new testing approaches
