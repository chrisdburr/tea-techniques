      "description": "Monte Carlo Dropout estimates prediction uncertainty by applying dropout (randomly setting neural network weights to zero) during inference rather than just training. It performs multiple forward passes through the network with different random dropout patterns and collects the resulting predictions to form a distribution. Low variance across predictions indicates epistemic certainty (the model is confident), while high variance suggests epistemic uncertainty (the model is unsure). This technique transforms any dropout-trained neural network into a Bayesian approximation for uncertainty quantification.",

It enhances detection by applying temperature scaling to soften the model's output distribution and adding small, carefully calibrated perturbations to the input that push in-distribution samples towards higher confidence predictions. By measuring the maximum softmax probability after these adjustments, ODIN can effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs, flagging potentially unreliable predictions before they cause downstream errors.",
