  "description": "Disparate Impact Remover is a preprocessing technique that transforms feature values in a dataset to reduce statistical dependence between features and protected attributes (like race or gender). The method modifies non-protected features through mathematical transformations that preserve the utility of the data whilst reducing correlations that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This approach specifically targets the '80% rule' disparate impact threshold by adjusting feature distributions to ensure more equitable treatment across demographic groups in downstream model predictions.",
