  "description": "UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that creates 2D or 3D visualisations of high-dimensional data by constructing a mathematical model of the data's underlying manifold structure. Unlike t-SNE, UMAP preserves both local neighbourhood relationships and global topology more effectively, using techniques from topological data analysis and Riemannian geometry. This approach often produces more interpretable cluster layouts while maintaining meaningful distances between clusters, making it particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex dataset structures.",
