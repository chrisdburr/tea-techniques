  "description": "Average Odds Difference measures fairness by calculating the average difference in both false positive rates and true positive rates between different demographic groups. This metric captures how consistently a model performs across groups for both positive and negative predictions. A value of 0 indicates perfect fairness under the equalized odds criterion, while larger absolute values indicate greater disparities in model performance between groups.",
