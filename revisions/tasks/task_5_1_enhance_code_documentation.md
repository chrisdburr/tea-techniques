## Task 5.1: Enhance Code Documentation

-   **Issue:** Need for more inline comments in complex areas and consistent docstrings.
-   **Priority:** Low
-   **Branch:** `docs/code-documentation`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **Backend:** Add docstrings to views, serializers, models, utility functions, and management commands following standard Python conventions (e.g., Google style or reStructuredText). Add inline comments explaining non-obvious logic.
    2.  **Frontend:** Add JSDoc comments to custom hooks (`useFilterParams`, `useForm`, API hooks) explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Add inline comments for complex component logic or effects.
-   **Considerations:** Can be done gradually. Focus on areas identified as complex during earlier refactoring.
-   **Testing:** Primarily involves code review. Ensure linters pass.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large.
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task.
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything.
    -   Next, run code quality tools.
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`.
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch.
