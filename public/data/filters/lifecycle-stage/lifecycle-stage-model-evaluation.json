      "description": "Prompt Sensitivity Analysis systematically evaluates how variations in input prompts affect large language model outputs, providing insights into model robustness, consistency, and interpretability. This technique involves creating controlled perturbations of prompts whilst maintaining semantic meaning, then measuring how these changes influence model responses. It encompasses various types of prompt modifications including lexical substitutions, syntactic restructuring, formatting changes, and contextual variations. The analysis typically quantifies sensitivity through metrics such as output consistency, semantic similarity, and statistical measures of variance across prompt variations.",

Unlike general counterfactual fairness, this approach enables practitioners to identify and intervene on particular causal paths that may introduce bias whilst preserving other legitimate pathways. The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
