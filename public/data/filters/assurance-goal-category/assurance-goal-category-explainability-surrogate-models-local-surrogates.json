      "description": "LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) explains individual predictions by approximating the complex model's behaviour in a small neighbourhood around a specific instance. It works by creating perturbed versions of the input (e.g., removing words from text, changing pixel values in images, or varying feature values), obtaining the model's predictions for these variations, and training a simple interpretable model (typically linear regression) weighted by proximity to the original instance. The coefficients of this local surrogate model reveal which features most influenced the specific prediction.",
