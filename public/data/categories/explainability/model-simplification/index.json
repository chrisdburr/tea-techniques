      "description": "Model distillation transfers knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student) by training the student to mimic the teacher's behaviour. The student learns from the teacher's soft predictions and intermediate representations rather than just hard labels, capturing nuanced decision boundaries and uncertainty. This produces models that are faster, require less memory, and are often more interpretable whilst maintaining much of the original performance. Beyond compression, distillation can improve model reliability by regularising training and enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.",
