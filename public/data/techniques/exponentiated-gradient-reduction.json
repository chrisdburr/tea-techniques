  "description": "An in-processing fairness technique based on Agarwal et al.'s reductions approach that transforms fair classification into a sequence of cost-sensitive classification problems. The method uses an exponentiated gradient algorithm to iteratively reweight training data, returning a randomised classifier that achieves the lowest empirical error whilst satisfying fairness constraints. This reduction-based framework provides theoretical guarantees about both accuracy and constraint violation, making it suitable for various fairness criteria including demographic parity and equalised odds.",
