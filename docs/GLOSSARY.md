# Glossary

## Assurance Terminology

### Assurance

The process of providing evidence and confidence that a system or product meets specified requirements and operates as intended.

### Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA)

A framework for evidencing claims about responsible AI design, development, and deployment, focusing on multiple dimensions of trustworthiness (e.g. fairness, explainability).

### Assurance Goal

A high-level objective, such as fairness, transparency, or safety, that guides the selection and application of assurance techniques and the development of an assurance case.

### Assurance Technique

A specific method, tool, or approach used to provide evidence about an aspect of AI system behavior or performance.

### Assurance Case

A structured argument, supported by evidence, that a system satisfies specific claims about its properties (i.e. property claims).

## Model Dependency Types

### Model-Agnostic

Techniques that can be applied to any model, regardless of its architecture or implementation details.

### Model-Specific

Techniques that are designed for or only applicable to specific types of models (e.g., deep neural networks, decision trees).

## Technique Attributes

### Scope

- **Local**: techniques that provide insights about specific predictions or decisions
- **Global**: techniques that provide insights about the model's overall behavior

### Application Stage

- **Pre-training**: applied before model training begins
- **In-training**: applied during model training
- **Post-training**: applied after model training is complete
- **Inference-time**: applied when the model makes predictions

### Implementation Approach

- **Statistical**: based on statistical methods and analyses
- **Formal**: based on formal verification or mathematical proofs
- **Empirical**: based on experimental observations and testing
- **Heuristic**: based on rules of thumb or best practices

### Complexity Rating (1-5)

A measure of how difficult a technique is to implement:

- **1**: Very simple, minimal technical knowledge required
- **2**: Relatively straightforward implementation
- **3**: Moderate complexity, requires some specialised knowledge
- **4**: Complex implementation, requires significant expertise
- **5**: Very complex, requires deep technical expertise

### Computational Cost Rating (1-5)

A measure of the computational resources required to implement a technique:

- **1**: Very lightweight, minimal computational resources needed
- **2**: Low computational requirements
- **3**: Moderate computational requirements
- **4**: High computational requirements
- **5**: Very computationally intensive
