  "description": "Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data without decrypting it first, producing encrypted results that, when decrypted, match the results of performing the same operations on the plaintext. This enables secure outsourced computation where sensitive data remains encrypted throughout processing. By allowing ML operations on encrypted data, it provides strong privacy guarantees for applications involving highly sensitive information.",
