  "name": "Model Development Audit Trails",
  "description": "Model development audit trails create comprehensive, immutable records of all decisions, experiments, and changes throughout the ML lifecycle. This technique captures dataset versions, training configurations, hyperparameter searches, model architecture changes, evaluation results, and deployment decisions in tamper-evident logs. Audit trails enable reproducibility, accountability, and regulatory compliance by documenting who made what changes when and why, supporting post-hoc investigation of model failures or unexpected behaviors.",
