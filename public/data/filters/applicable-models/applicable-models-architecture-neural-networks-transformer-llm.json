      "description": "Prompt Sensitivity Analysis systematically evaluates how variations in input prompts affect large language model outputs, providing insights into model robustness, consistency, and interpretability. This technique involves creating controlled perturbations of prompts whilst maintaining semantic meaning, then measuring how these changes influence model responses. It encompasses various types of prompt modifications including lexical substitutions, syntactic restructuring, formatting changes, and contextual variations. The analysis typically quantifies sensitivity through metrics such as output consistency, semantic similarity, and statistical measures of variance across prompt variations.",

By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",
