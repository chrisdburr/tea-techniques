# TEA Techniques - Testing & CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Project Assessment Summary

### Current State
- **Backend**: Django with comprehensive API tests (7.5/10) - well-structured but missing management command tests
- **Frontend**: Next.js with basic testing setup but limited coverage (4/10) - MSW issues, minimal component coverage
- **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions, no .vscode setup, no automated quality checks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup 
- [x] Review repository structure and current testing setup
- [x] Analyze backend testing infrastructure and coverage  
- [x] Analyze frontend testing infrastructure and coverage
- [x] Create comprehensive plan document
- [ ] Set up local development environment (.vscode)

### Phase 2: Backend Testing Enhancement 
- [x] Add tests for management commands (import_techniques, reset_and_import_techniques)
- [ ] Add serializer validation tests
- [ ] Enhance error handling test coverage
- [ ] Add performance/load testing for critical endpoints
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and enforcement

### Phase 3: Frontend Testing Overhaul
- [x] Fix MSW integration issues
- [x] Create comprehensive test utilities and mock factories
- [ ] Add tests for core components (TechniqueCard, TechniquesList, TechniquesSidebar)
- [ ] Add tests for layout components (Header, Footer, MainLayout)
- [x] Add API client testing with proper MSW setup
- [ ] Add Context/Provider testing (AuthContext, DarkModeContext)

### Phase 4: Local Development Setup
- [x] Create .vscode workspace settings
- [x] Add recommended extensions
- [x] Configure debugging settings for both frontend and backend
- [x] Add code formatting and linting configurations
- [x] Create development task configurations

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- [x] Create .github/workflows directory structure
- [x] Implement backend CI workflow (lint, type-check, test, coverage)
- [x] Implement frontend CI workflow (lint, type-check, test, build)
- [x] Add Docker-based testing in CI
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [x] Add automated dependency updates

### Phase 6: Advanced Testing Features
- [x] Add E2E testing with Playwright
- [ ] Implement accessibility testing (jest-axe)
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Add security testing (dependency scanning)

### Phase 7: Quality Gates & Documentation
- [ ] Enforce test coverage thresholds
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Create testing documentation
- [ ] Set up automated changelog generation
- [ ] Add deployment automation

## Success Criteria
- âœ… 90%+ test coverage for both backend and frontend
- âœ… All PRs pass automated quality checks
- âœ… Local development environment fully configured
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline prevents broken code from merging
- âœ… E2E tests cover critical user journeys

## Current Progress

### Completed âœ…
- Repository structure analysis
- Backend testing assessment (comprehensive API tests, good factory pattern usage)
- Frontend testing assessment (basic setup, MSW integration issues identified)
- Created feature branch for implementation
- Set up .vscode workspace with comprehensive settings and extensions
- Created GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with backend, frontend, and E2E workflows
- Fixed MSW integration in frontend with proper handlers and test utilities
- Added comprehensive test for management commands
- Updated existing tests to use new MSW setup
- Added E2E testing with Playwright configuration
- Created dependency update automation workflow

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- Enhancing component test coverage
- Adding accessibility testing

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Add more component tests for TechniqueCard, TechniquesList, etc.
2. Implement accessibility testing with jest-axe
3. Add serializer validation tests for backend
4. Set up branch protection rules
5. Test the complete CI/CD pipeline
