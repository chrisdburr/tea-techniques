  "name": "Constitutional AI Evaluation",
  "description": "Constitutional AI evaluation assesses models trained to follow explicit behavioral principles or 'constitutions' that specify desired values and constraints. This technique verifies that models consistently adhere to specified principles across diverse scenarios, measuring both principle compliance and handling of principle conflicts. Evaluation includes testing boundary cases where principles might conflict, measuring robustness to adversarial attempts to violate principles, and assessing whether models can explain their reasoning in terms of constitutional principles.",
