The technique calculates first-order indices (individual feature contributions) and total-order indices (including all interaction effects involving that feature). By systematically sampling the input space and decomposing output variance, Sobol Indices reveal which features drive model uncertainty and which interactions between features are most important for predictions.",

By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",
