  "description": "Permutation Importance quantifies a feature's contribution to a model's performance by randomly shuffling its values and measuring the resulting drop in predictive accuracy. If shuffling a feature significantly degrades the model's performance, that feature is considered important. This model-agnostic technique helps identify which inputs are genuinely driving predictions, rather than just being correlated with the outcome.",
