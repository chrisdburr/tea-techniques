  "description": "Quantile regression estimates specific percentiles (quantiles) of the target variable rather than just predicting the average outcome. For example, instead of predicting 'average house price = £300,000', it can predict 'there's a 10% chance the price will be below £250,000, 50% chance below £300,000, and 90% chance below £380,000'. This technique reveals how input features affect different parts of the outcome distribution - perhaps property size strongly influences luxury homes (90th percentile) but barely affects budget properties (10th percentile). By capturing the full conditional distribution, quantile regression provides rich uncertainty information and enables robust prediction intervals.",
