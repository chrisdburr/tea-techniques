      "description": "Reweighing is a pre-processing technique that mitigates bias by assigning different weights to training examples based on their group membership and class label. The weights are calculated to ensure that privileged and unprivileged groups have equal influence on the model's training process, effectively balancing the dataset without altering the feature values themselves. This helps to train fairer models by correcting for historical imbalances in how different groups are represented in the data.",
