  "description": "Federated learning enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed parties (devices, organisations, or data centres) without requiring centralised data sharing. Participants train models locally on their private datasets and only share model updates (gradients, weights, or aggregated statistics) with a central coordinator. This distributed approach serves multiple purposes: preserving data privacy and sovereignty, reducing communication costs, enabling learning from diverse data sources, improving model robustness through heterogeneous training, and facilitating compliance with data protection regulations whilst maintaining model performance comparable to centralised training.",
