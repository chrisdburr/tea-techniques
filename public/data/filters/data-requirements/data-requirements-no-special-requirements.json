Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

Unlike t-SNE, UMAP preserves both local neighbourhood relationships and global topology more effectively, using techniques from topological data analysis and Riemannian geometry. This approach often produces more interpretable cluster layouts while maintaining meaningful distances between clusters, making it particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex dataset structures.",

It works by learning a sparse linear model that combines automatically extracted decision rules with original features. The technique first builds tree ensembles to generate candidate rules, then uses LASSO regression to select the most important rules and features. The resulting model provides global explanations through human-readable rules (e.g., 'IF age > 50 AND income < 30k THEN ...') combined with linear feature weights, making complex model behavior transparent and auditable.",

The technique encompasses various approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), statistical sampling methods, and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy. Beyond privacy protection, synthetic data serves multiple purposes: augmenting limited datasets, balancing class distributions, testing model robustness, enabling data sharing across organisations, and supporting fairness assessments by generating representative samples for underrepresented groups.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, instead of predicting 'house price: £300,000', a prediction interval might say 'house price: £280,000 to £320,000 with 95% confidence'. This technique works by calculating upper and lower bounds that account for both model uncertainty (how confident the model is) and inherent randomness in the data. Prediction intervals are crucial for informed decision-making, as they help users understand the reliability and precision of predictions, enabling better risk assessment and planning.",
