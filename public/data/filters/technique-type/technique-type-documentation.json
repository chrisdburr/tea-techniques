      "description": "Model cards are standardised documentation frameworks that systematically document machine learning models through structured templates. The templates cover intended use cases, performance metrics across different demographic groups and operating conditions, training data characteristics, evaluation procedures, limitations, and ethical considerations. They serve as comprehensive technical specifications that enable informed model selection, prevent inappropriate deployment, support regulatory compliance, and facilitate fair assessment by providing transparent reporting of model capabilities and constraints across diverse populations and scenarios.",
