  "name": "Multi-Agent System Verification",
  "description": "Multi-agent system verification tests the safety and reliability of systems where multiple AI agents interact, coordinate, or compete. This technique evaluates emergent behaviors, communication protocol adherence, conflict resolution mechanisms, and whether agents maintain individual and collective objectives appropriately. Verification includes testing edge cases where agent goals conflict, communication fails, or unexpected coalitions form, ensuring the overall system behaves safely even when individual agent behaviors combine in complex ways.",
