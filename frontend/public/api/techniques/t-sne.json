  "description": "t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that creates 2D or 3D visualisations of high-dimensional data by preserving local neighbourhood relationships. The algorithm converts similarities between data points into joint probabilities in the high-dimensional space, then tries to minimise the divergence between these probabilities and those in the low-dimensional embedding. This approach excels at revealing cluster structures and local patterns, making it particularly effective for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex data relationships that linear methods like PCA might miss.",
