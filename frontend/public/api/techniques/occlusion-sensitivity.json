  "description": "Occlusion sensitivity tests which parts of the input are important by occluding (masking or removing) them and seeing how the model's prediction changes. For example, portions of an image can be covered up in a sliding window fashion; if the model's confidence drops significantly when a certain region is occluded, that region was important for the prediction.",
