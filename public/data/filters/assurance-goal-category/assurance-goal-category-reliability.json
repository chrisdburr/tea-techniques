This technique reveals how input features affect different parts of the outcome distribution - perhaps property size strongly influences luxury homes (90th percentile) but barely affects budget properties (10th percentile). By capturing the full conditional distribution, quantile regression provides rich uncertainty information and enables robust prediction intervals.",

For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",

By training several models on the same data with different starting points, the ensemble reveals how much the model's predictions depend on training randomness. The disagreement between ensemble members naturally indicates prediction uncertainty - when models agree, confidence is high; when they disagree, uncertainty is revealed. This approach provides more reliable uncertainty estimates, better out-of-distribution detection, and improved calibration compared to single models.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features.
