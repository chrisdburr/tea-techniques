      "description": "Synthetic data generation creates artificial datasets that aim to preserve the statistical properties, distributions, and relationships of real data whilst containing no actual records from real individuals. The technique encompasses various approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), statistical sampling methods, and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy. Beyond privacy protection, synthetic data serves multiple purposes: augmenting limited datasets, balancing class distributions, testing model robustness, enabling data sharing across organisations, and supporting fairness assessments by generating representative samples for underrepresented groups.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",
