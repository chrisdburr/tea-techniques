This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

    "description": "A post-processing fairness technique that adjusts model predictions to achieve equal true positive rates across protected groups whilst maintaining calibration within each group. The method addresses fairness by ensuring that qualified individuals from different demographic groups have equal chances of receiving positive predictions, whilst preserving the meaning of probability scores within each group. This technique attempts to balance the competing objectives of group fairness and accurate probability estimation.",

The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
