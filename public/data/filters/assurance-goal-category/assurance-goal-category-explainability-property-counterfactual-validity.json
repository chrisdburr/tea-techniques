      "description": "The Contrastive Explanation Method (CEM) explains model decisions by generating contrastive examples that reveal what makes a prediction distinctive. It identifies 'pertinent negatives' (minimal features that could be removed to change the prediction) and 'pertinent positives' (minimal features that must be present to maintain the prediction). This approach helps users understand not just what led to a decision, but what would need to change to achieve a different outcome, providing actionable insights for decision-making.",
