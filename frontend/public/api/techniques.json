Using calculus and the implicit function theorem, they approximate this 'leave-one-out' effect without actually retraining the model by computing gradients and Hessian information. This mathematical approach reveals which specific training examples were most responsible for pushing the model toward or away from particular predictions, enabling practitioners to trace problematic outputs back to their root causes in the training data.",

This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",

By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features.
