  "description": "Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), also known as Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV), identify mathematical directions in neural network representation space that correspond to human-understandable concepts such as 'stripes', 'young', or 'medical equipment'. The technique works by finding linear directions that separate activations of concept examples from non-concept examples, then measuring how much these concept directions influence the model's predictions. This provides quantitative answers to questions like 'How much does the concept of youth affect this model's hiring decisions?' enabling systematic bias detection and model understanding.",
