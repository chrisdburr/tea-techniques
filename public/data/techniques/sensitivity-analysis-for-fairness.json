  "name": "Sensitivity Analysis for Fairness",
  "description": "Sensitivity Analysis for Fairness systematically evaluates how model predictions change when sensitive attributes or their proxies are perturbed whilst holding other factors constant. The technique involves creating counterfactual instances by modifying potentially discriminatory features (race, gender, age) or their correlates (zip code, names, education institutions) and measuring the resulting prediction differences. This controlled perturbation approach quantifies the degree to which protected characteristics influence model decisions, helping detect both direct discrimination and indirect bias through proxy variables even when sensitive attributes are not explicitly used as model inputs.",
