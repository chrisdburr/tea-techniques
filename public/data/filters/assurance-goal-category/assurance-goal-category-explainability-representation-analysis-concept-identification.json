      "description": "Neuron activation analysis examines the firing patterns of individual neurons in neural networks by probing them with diverse inputs and analysing their activation responses. This technique helps understand what concepts, features, or patterns different neurons have learned to recognise, providing insights into the model's internal representations. For large language models, this can reveal neurons specialised for linguistic concepts, semantic categories, or even potentially harmful patterns, enabling targeted interventions and deeper model understanding.",
