It quantifies fairness using metrics like Statistical Parity Difference (the absolute difference in positive outcome rates between groups) or Disparate Impact ratio (the ratio of positive rates). Unlike techniques that modify data or models, this is purely a measurement approach that highlights when protected groups receive favourable outcomes at different rates, helping organisations identify and document potential discrimination.",

The method modifies non-protected features through mathematical transformations that preserve the utility of the data whilst reducing correlations that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This approach specifically targets the '80% rule' disparate impact threshold by adjusting feature distributions to ensure more equitable treatment across demographic groups in downstream model predictions.",
