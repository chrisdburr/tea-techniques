## Task 3.2: Add Backend Type Hinting

-   **Issue:** Backend Python code lacks type hints.
-   **Priority:** Medium
-   **Branch:** `refactor/backend-type-hints`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **Configure Type Checker:** Add `mypy` to `dev` dependencies in `backend/pyproject.toml`. Configure `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml [tool.mypy]` section.
    2.  **Add Hints Incrementally:** Start adding type hints to key files:
        -   `backend/api/models.py`
        -   `backend/api/serializers.py`
        -   `backend/api/views/api_views.py`
        -   `backend/api/utils.py`
        -   Management commands (`commands/`).
    3.  **Run Mypy:** Regularly run `poetry run mypy .` within the `backend` directory to check types and fix errors.
-   **Considerations:** Can be done incrementally. Focus on function signatures and complex areas first. Requires familiarity with Python typing and potentially `django-stubs`.
-   **Testing:** Run `mypy`. Ensure backend tests still pass.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large.
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task.
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything.
    -   Next, run code quality tools.
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`.
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch.

## Summary of Changes

The following changes were implemented to add type hints to the backend Python code:

1. **Configuration:**
   - Added `mypy` and related type stubs packages to dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
   - Configured mypy settings in `pyproject.toml` [tool.mypy] section
   - Added overrides to ignore migrations and tests for stricter type checking

2. **Added Type Hints:**
   - Function return types for all methods in models (`__str__` methods)
   - Type hints for serializer method fields
   - Type annotations for view methods including permissions, responses
   - Function parameters in management commands
   - Added proper typing for API views and utility functions
   
3. **Fixed Test Code:**
   - Updated tests to accommodate model relationship changes (particularly AttributeValue model)
   - Fixed factory class to support direct technique relationship with AttributeValue

4. **Results:**
   - Successfully ran mypy on key files to identify type issues
   - Fixed critical typing errors while allowing some Django-specific ones to remain
   - Improved code readability and developer experience
   - All model tests now pass with type hints in place

This task provides a foundation for further type hinting work. While not all type errors were fixed, the most important function signatures and method return types now have proper annotations, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to reason about.
