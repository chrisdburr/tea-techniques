Unlike simpler attribution methods, it separates the direct contribution of specific words or phrases from the contextual effects of surrounding words. This is particularly useful for understanding how sequential models process language, as it can identify whether a word's influence comes from its individual meaning or from its interaction with nearby words in the sequence.",

This path integral ensures that the attributions satisfy fundamental axioms like completeness (attributions sum up to the difference between the prediction and the baseline prediction) and sensitivity (non-zero attributions for features that change the prediction). The output is a set of importance scores, often visualised as heatmaps, indicating which parts of the input were most influential for the model's decision.",
