  "description": "RuleFit is a method that creates an interpretable model by combining linear terms with decision rules. It first extracts potential rules from ensemble trees, then builds a sparse linear model where those rules (binary conditions) and original features are used as predictors, with regularization to keep the model simple. The final model is a linear combination of a small set of rules and original features, balancing interpretability with predictive power.",
