For example, in a dataset of customer transactions, prototypes might be the most representative buying patterns (frequent small purchases, occasional large purchases), whilst criticisms could be unusual behaviors (bulk buyers, one-time high-value customers). This dual approach reveals both what is normal and what is exceptional, helping understand data coverage and model blind spots.",

Using calculus and the implicit function theorem, they approximate this 'leave-one-out' effect without actually retraining the model by computing gradients and Hessian information. This mathematical approach reveals which specific training examples were most responsible for pushing the model toward or away from particular predictions, enabling practitioners to trace problematic outputs back to their root causes in the training data.",
