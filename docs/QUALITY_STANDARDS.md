# TEA Techniques - Quality Assurance Standards

This document establishes non-negotiable quality gates and coverage requirements for the TEA Techniques project. These standards ensure maintainable, reliable, and secure code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Philosophy

**"Quality is not an act, it is a habit"** - All code must meet these standards before merging.

### Core Principles
1. **Fail Fast**: Catch issues as early as possible in the development cycle
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test the critical paths that matter to users
3. **Security First**: Never compromise on security for convenience
4. **Performance Awareness**: Maintain performance standards as the codebase grows
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure inclusive user experiences

## ðŸ”§ Backend Quality Standards

### Coverage Requirements

#### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
- **Line Coverage**: 90% minimum across all modules
- **Branch Coverage**: 85% minimum (pytest-cov tracks this automatically)
- **Function Coverage**: 95% for public API methods
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for business logic functions

#### Coverage Configuration
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=api --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Coverage fails if below 90%
uv run pytest --cov-fail-under=90
```

#### Exemptions from Coverage
- Migration files (`*/migrations/*`)
- Test files themselves (`*/tests/*`)
- Configuration files (`config/settings/*`)
- Django admin configurations (when justified)
- `__str__` and `__repr__` methods (unless business critical)

### Code Quality Standards

#### Type Checking (mypy)
- **Strictness Level**: Progressive typing approach
- **Required**: All new functions must have type hints
- **Configuration**: Defined in `pyproject.toml`
- **Enforcement**: CI fails on mypy errors

```bash
# Run type checking
uv run mypy api/
```

#### Linting (Ruff)
- **Modern Tool**: Rust-based linter for speed and accuracy
- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters
- **Complexity**: Maximum 15 branches per function
- **Configuration**: Django-aware rules in pyproject.toml

```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check api/
```

#### Code Formatting
- **Tool**: Ruff (automatic formatting and import sorting)
- **Line Length**: 120 characters (consistent with linting)
- **Import Sorting**: Built into Ruff for consistent organization

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format api/
```

### Testing Standards

#### Test Organization
```
api/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # 60% of tests - Pure unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # 30% of tests - Database integration
â”œâ”€â”€ api/           # 10% of tests - Full HTTP testing
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/       # Test data
â”œâ”€â”€ factories/      # Model factories
â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Test utilities
```

#### Test Quality Requirements
- **Isolation**: Each test must be independent and repeatable
- **Realistic Data**: Use domain-specific test data (TEA techniques, goals)
- **Performance**: Individual tests must complete under 1 second
- **Clarity**: Test names must clearly describe what is being tested

#### Prohibited Testing Patterns
- **No Mocking Database**: Use real database interactions in integration tests
- **No Overmocking**: Mock only external services, not internal code
- **No Flaky Tests**: Tests must pass consistently 100% of the time
- **No Skipped Tests**: All tests must run in CI (mark slow tests, don't skip)

### Security Standards

#### Django Security
- **SECRET_KEY**: Must be environment variable, never hardcoded
- **DEBUG**: Must be False in production
- **ALLOWED_HOSTS**: Properly configured for deployment environment
- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS in production settings

#### Dependency Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: All dependencies scanned for known vulnerabilities
- **Regular Updates**: Security updates applied within 48 hours
- **License Compliance**: All dependencies must have compatible licenses

#### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: No sensitive data in logs or error messages
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection**: Use Django ORM, no raw SQL without justification

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Quality Standards

### Coverage Requirements

#### Component Coverage Thresholds
- **Line Coverage**: 85% minimum for all components
- **Branch Coverage**: 80% minimum for conditional logic
- **Function Coverage**: 90% for event handlers and methods
- **User Interaction Coverage**: 100% of interactive elements tested

#### Coverage Configuration (Vitest)
```json
{
  "coverage": {
    "thresholds": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 80,
        "functions": 80,
        "lines": 85,
        "statements": 85
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Exemptions from Coverage
- Next.js generated files (`layout.tsx`, `globals.css`)
- Type definition files (`*.d.ts`)
- Storybook configuration files
- Build and configuration files

### Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Standards
- **Strictness**: `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- **No Any**: Avoid `any` type, use proper typing
- **Type Coverage**: 95% of code should be properly typed
- **Enforcement**: CI fails on TypeScript errors

```bash
# Type checking
pnpm type-check
```

#### Linting (ESLint)
- **Configuration**: Next.js recommended + custom rules
- **Accessibility**: eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for accessibility compliance
- **React Hooks**: Proper hooks dependency arrays
- **Performance**: Prevent common React performance issues

```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

#### Code Formatting (Prettier)
- **Automatic Formatting**: Enforced in pre-commit hooks
- **Configuration**: Consistent with backend line length (120 chars)
- **Import Organization**: Automatic import sorting

### Testing Standards

#### Test Organization
```
src/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Component unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Page and feature integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/       # Realistic test data
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Test utilities and helpers
â””â”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests (Playwright)
```

#### Component Testing Requirements
- **User-Centric**: Test from user perspective, not implementation details
- **Accessibility**: Every interactive component tested with jest-axe
- **Real Interactions**: Use user-event for realistic interactions
- **Error States**: Test loading, error, and empty states

#### API Integration Testing
- **Minimal Mocking**: Direct API testing where possible
- **Realistic Responses**: Use actual API response shapes
- **Error Handling**: Test network failures and API errors

### Accessibility Standards

#### WCAG Compliance
- **Level**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Testing**: Automated testing with jest-axe

- **Tools**: axe-core for comprehensive accessibility checking

#### Required Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

```javascript
// Example accessibility test
it('meets WCAG accessibility standards', async () => {
  const renderResult = renderWithProviders(<Component />)
  await testAccessibility(renderResult)
})
```

### Performance Standards

#### Runtime Performance
- **Component Rendering**: Individual components render under 50ms
