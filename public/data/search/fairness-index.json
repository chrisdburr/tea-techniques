Unlike general counterfactual fairness, this approach enables practitioners to identify and intervene on particular causal paths that may introduce bias whilst preserving other legitimate pathways. The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
