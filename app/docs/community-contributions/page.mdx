TEA Techniques thrives on community contributions. Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or
organization working on responsible AI, your insights and experiences can help others in the field.
This guide explains how to contribute effectively.

## Ways to Contribute

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Submit New Techniques

If you've developed or successfully applied a technique for AI assurance that isn't in our collection, we encourage you to submit it. New techniques help expand the toolkit available to the community.

### ‚ú® Improve Existing techniques

Have you found a better way to implement a technique? Or discovered additional considerations? Your improvements help keep techniques current and practical.

### üìÑ Share Case Studies

Real-world examples make techniques more accessible. Share how you've applied techniques in practice, including challenges faced and results achieved.

You can also do this via the [TEA Platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net) if you have an assurance case or argument patten that you'd like to share with the community.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- **Check existing techniques:** Ensure your contribution doesn't duplicate existing content
- **Review the evaluation criteria:** Familiarise yourself with our
  [evaluation standards](/about/technique-evaluation)
- **Gather supporting evidence:** Collect research papers, case studies, or implementation examples

### 2. Prepare Your Contribution

Use the following template structure for new techniques:

{/* Add schema and template once developed */}

### 3. Submit Your Contribution

**Via GitHub (Preferred):**

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `feature/technique-name`
3. Add your technique to `data/techniques.json`
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

**Via Issue:** If you're not comfortable with Git, create an issue with your technique details and
we'll help integrate it.

### 4. Review Process

After submission, your contribution will go through:

- Initial review for completeness and alignment
- Community discussion and feedback
- Technical validation by domain experts
- Final approval and integration

This process typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on the complexity of the contribution.
