  "description": "Sobol Indices quantify how much each input feature contributes to the total variance in a model's predictions through global sensitivity analysis. The technique calculates first-order indices (individual feature contributions) and total-order indices (including all interaction effects involving that feature). By systematically sampling the input space and decomposing output variance, Sobol Indices reveal which features drive model uncertainty and which interactions between features are most important for predictions.",
