It enhances detection by applying temperature scaling to soften the model's output distribution and adding small, carefully calibrated perturbations to the input that push in-distribution samples towards higher confidence predictions. By measuring the maximum softmax probability after these adjustments, ODIN can effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs, flagging potentially unreliable predictions before they cause downstream errors.",

      "description": "An intrinsically interpretable modelling technique that extends linear models by allowing flexible, nonlinear relationships between individual features and the target whilst maintaining the additive structure that preserves transparency. Each feature's effect is modelled separately as a smooth function, visualised as a curve showing how the feature influences predictions across its range. GAMs achieve this through spline functions or other smoothing techniques that capture complex patterns in individual variables without interactions, making them particularly valuable for domains requiring both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.",
