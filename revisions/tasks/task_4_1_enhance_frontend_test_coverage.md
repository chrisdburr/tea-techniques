## Task 4.1: Enhance Frontend Test Coverage

-   **Issue:** Frontend test suite lacks coverage for complex custom hooks (`useFilterParams`, `useForm`) and potentially critical component interactions.
-   **Priority:** Medium
-   **Branch:** `test/frontend-coverage`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **Test `useFilterParams`:** Write unit/integration tests specifically for `useFilterParams.ts`. Mock `next/navigation` hooks (`useSearchParams`, `useRouter`). Test state updates, URL parameter generation, and interaction with `applyFilters`, `resetFilters`, `changePage`. ✅
    2.  **Test `useForm` (if not replaced):** Write unit tests for `useForm.ts`. Test state initialization, `handleChange`, `handleBlur`, `setFieldValue`, validation logic, and `resetForm`. ✅
    3.  **Test `TechniqueForm`:** Write integration tests for `TechniqueForm.tsx`. Simulate user input, dynamic field additions/removals (Use Cases, Resources), validation errors, and successful/failed submissions (mocking API hooks). ✅
    4.  **Test Error Handling:** Add tests for components that display errors (e.g., API errors in `TechniquesList`, form errors in `TechniqueForm`), ensuring they render correctly based on mocked error states. ✅
    5.  **Review Coverage:** Use Jest's coverage reporting (`npm run test -- --coverage`) to identify other critical untested areas. ✅
-   **Considerations:** Testing hooks involving routing can be tricky. Ensure mocks for `next/navigation` are accurate.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes ✅
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large. ✅
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task. ✅
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything. ✅
    -   Next, run code quality tools. ✅
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`. ✅
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch. ✅

## Summary of Changes

The frontend test coverage has been significantly enhanced with the addition of comprehensive test suites for key components of the application:

1. **Custom Hooks Tests:**
   - Added tests for `useFilterParams` hook covering URL parameter handling, filter state management, and navigation actions
   - Added tests for `useForm` hook covering form state management, validation, field updates, and form reset functionality
   - Added tests for `useApiError` hook covering error handling for different API error scenarios

2. **Component Tests:**
   - Enhanced `TechniqueForm` tests with more thorough coverage of:
     - Form rendering in create and edit modes
     - Form submissions with validation
     - Dynamic field management (adding/removing use cases and resources)
     - Form validation error display
     - Loading state display during submissions
     - Navigation handling

3. **Test Infrastructure:**
   - Updated Jest configuration to improve test reliability
   - Fixed MSW (Mock Service Worker) setup for API mocking
   - Implemented proper mocking for Next.js navigation hooks
   - Added comprehensive mock data for API responses

These tests provide much better validation of the frontend's core functionality, ensuring that future changes don't introduce regressions in these critical areas. The test coverage now includes key user flows like form submissions, validation error handling, and dynamic component interactions.
