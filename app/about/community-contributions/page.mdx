TEA Techniques thrives on community contributions. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or AI practitioner, your insights and experiences can help others in the field.
This guide explains how to contribute effectively.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

1. **Submit New Techniques**: if you know about or have developed a technique that isn't in our collection, we encourage you to submit it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tea-techniques/issues) or opening a [pull request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tea-techniques/pulls). New techniques help expand the toolkit available to the community.
2. **Improve Existing techniques**: have you found a typo, correction, or a better way to implement an existing technique? Your improvements help keep techniques current and practical.
3. **Share Case Studies**: real-world examples make techniques more accessible. Share how you've applied techniques in practice, including challenges faced and results achieved. The best way to do this is via the [TEA Platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net) where you can share case studies with attached assurance cases.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- **Check existing techniques:** Ensure your contribution doesn't duplicate existing content
- **Review the evaluation criteria:** Familiarise yourself with our
  [evaluation standards](/about/technique-evaluation)
- **Gather supporting evidence:** Collect research papers, case studies, or implementation examples

### 2. Prepare Your Contribution

~Use the following template structure for new techniques:~

Coming soon!

{/* Add schema and template once developed */}

### 3. Submit Your Contribution

**Via GitHub (Preferred):**

1. Fork our repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tea-techniques](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/tea-techniques)
2. Create a new branch: `technique-submission/technique-name`
3. Add your new technique or revision to `data/techniques.json`
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

**Via Issue:** If you're not comfortable with Git, create an issue with your technique details and
we'll help integrate it.

### 4. Review Process

After submission, your contribution will go through:

- Review for completeness and alignment with our [evaluation standards](/about/technique-evaluation)
- Request for any amendments
- Final approval and integration

This process typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on the complexity of the contribution.
