      "description": "Adversarial debiasing reduces bias by training models using a competitive adversarial setup, similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The technique involves two neural networks: a predictor that learns to make accurate predictions on the main task, and an adversary (bias detector) that attempts to predict protected attributes (such as race, gender, or age) from the predictor's internal representations. Through adversarial training, the predictor learns to produce representations that retain predictive power for the main task whilst being uninformative about protected characteristics, thereby reducing discriminatory bias.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",
