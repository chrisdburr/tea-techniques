  "description": "Tool use safety verification tests AI agents that interact with external tools, APIs, and systems to ensure they use capabilities safely and as intended. This technique evaluates whether agents correctly understand tool specifications, respect usage constraints, handle errors gracefully, and avoid unintended side effects. Testing includes boundary condition validation (extreme parameters, edge cases), permission verification (ensuring agents don't exceed authorized actions), and cascade failure analysis (how tool errors propagate through multi-step agent workflows).",
