# Comprehensive Test Implementation Plan with Refactoring

## Overview
This plan implements comprehensive test coverage for the TEA Techniques project. Based on codebase analysis, several components are overly complex and need refactoring before testing to ensure we're testing clean, maintainable code rather than cementing poor patterns.

## Critical Complexity Issues Identified

### Backend Complexity Issues (Must Refactor First):
1. **TechniqueSerializer** (318 lines) - `create()` and `update()` methods are 80+ lines each
2. **import_techniques.py** (424 lines) - `_process_technique()` method is 150+ lines 
3. **debug_endpoint** (95+ lines) - Multiple responsibilities in single function

### Frontend Complexity Issues (Must Refactor First):
1. **TechniqueForm.tsx** (850 lines) - Extremely complex component with multiple responsibilities
2. Other components are reasonably sized

---

## Phase 0: Code Refactoring (Essential Prerequisite)

### 0.1: Backend Refactoring
**Target**: Break down overly complex methods into smaller, testable units

**TechniqueSerializer Refactoring**:
- Extract relationship handling logic into separate service methods
- Create dedicated handlers for resources, use cases, and limitations
- Implement transaction-safe bulk operations
- Add proper error handling and validation

**Management Command Refactoring**:
- Split `_process_technique()` into smaller, focused methods
- Extract data parsing logic into separate utilities
- Create dedicated validators for different data types
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

**Debug Endpoint Refactoring**:
- Split into separate health check and debug info endpoints
- Extract settings sanitization into utility function
- Create dedicated request info formatter

### 0.2: Frontend Refactoring  
**Target**: Break TechniqueForm into composable, testable components

**TechniqueForm Refactoring**:
- Extract tab panels into separate components
- Create reusable form field components
- Split dynamic array management into custom hooks
- Extract form validation logic
- Create specialized components for resources, use cases, limitations

- Data migration workflows

### 1.3: API Tests (10% of backend tests)
**Target**: Full HTTP request/response cycle testing

**ViewSet CRUD Operations**:
- AssuranceGoals, Tags, ResourceTypes, Techniques ViewSets
- Authentication and permission enforcement
- Filtering, searching, and pagination
- Error responses and status codes

**Authentication Flow Testing**:
- Login/logout functionality
- CSRF token handling
- Session management
- Permission-based access control

**API Performance Testing**:
- Response time validation
- Database query optimization
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent request handling

## Phase 2: Frontend Testing Implementation

### 2.1: Component Unit Tests (70% of frontend tests)
**Target**: 85% coverage for individual components

**Refactored Component Testing** (After Refactoring):
- Individual form tab components
- Reusable form field components
- Custom hooks for form management
- UI component interactions
- State management logic

**Existing Component Testing**:
- TechniqueCard, TechniquesList, TechniquesSidebar
- Navigation and layout components
- UI component library (buttons, cards, etc.)
- Authentication components

**Hook Testing**:
- Custom form hooks
- API integration hooks
- Error handling hooks
- Pagination and filtering hooks

### 2.2: Integration Tests (20% of frontend tests)
**Target**: Page-level functionality with realistic workflows

**Page Integration Testing**:
- Complete technique creation/editing workflows
- Search and filtering functionality
- Navigation between pages
- Authentication-protected routes

**API Integration Testing**:
- Real API calls (not mocked) where possible
- Error handling and recovery
- Loading states and user feedback
- Optimistic updates and data synchronization

### 2.3: Accessibility & E2E Tests (10% of frontend tests)
**Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and critical user journeys

**Accessibility Testing**:
- WCAG compliance for all interactive components
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast and visual accessibility

**End-to-End Testing**:
- Critical user journeys (view â†’ create â†’ edit techniques)
- Cross-browser functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance benchmarks

## Phase 3: Quality Control & Validation

### 3.1: Coverage Validation
**Target**: Ensure coverage requirements are met

**Backend Coverage Verification**:
- 90% line coverage enforcement
- Critical path coverage validation
- Integration test coverage analysis
- Performance benchmark establishment

**Frontend Coverage Verification**:
- 85% line coverage enforcement
- Accessibility compliance validation
