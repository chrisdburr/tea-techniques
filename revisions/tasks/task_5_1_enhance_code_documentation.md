## Task 5.1: Enhance Code Documentation

-   **Issue:** Need for more inline comments in complex areas and consistent docstrings.
-   **Priority:** Low
-   **Branch:** `docs/code-documentation`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **Backend:** Add docstrings to views, serializers, models, utility functions, and management commands following standard Python conventions (e.g., Google style or reStructuredText). Add inline comments explaining non-obvious logic.
    2.  **Frontend:** Add JSDoc comments to custom hooks (`useFilterParams`, `useForm`, API hooks) explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Add inline comments for complex component logic or effects.
-   **Considerations:** Can be done gradually. Focus on areas identified as complex during earlier refactoring.
-   **Testing:** Primarily involves code review. Ensure linters pass.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large.
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task.
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything.
    -   Next, run code quality tools.
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`.
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch.

## Summary of Changes

This task has enhanced the code documentation across both the backend and frontend of the Tea Techniques application:

### Backend Documentation Improvements:
1. **Models:**
   - Added comprehensive docstrings to all model classes (`AssuranceGoal`, `Category`, `SubCategory`, `Tag`, `ResourceType`, `Technique`, `AttributeType`, `AttributeValue`, `TechniqueResource`, `TechniqueExampleUseCase`, `TechniqueLimitation`) explaining their purpose and relationships.

2. **Serializers:**
   - Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose of serializers
   - Added docstrings to all serializer classes and their methods, particularly for complex methods with custom logic

3. **Utility Functions:**
   - Enhanced the documentation for the error handling utility functions

4. **API Views:**
   - Improved existing docstrings for the TechniquesViewSet and other view functions

### Frontend Documentation Improvements:
1. **Custom Hooks:**
   - **useFilterParams**: Added JSDoc comments to all methods explaining parameter handling, URL generation, and navigation logic
   - **useForm**: Added detailed documentation for form state management, validation, and error handling
   - **API Hooks**: Added JSDoc comments to all API-related hooks, explaining their parameters, return values, and error handling

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - Added detailed documentation to utility functions like `fetchAPI` and `calculateTotalPages`

These improvements enhance the codebase's maintainability by:
1. Making the purpose and behavior of each component clearer
2. Explaining complex logic and edge cases
3. Documenting parameter types and return values
4. Clarifying relationships between models and components
5. Providing context for future developers working on the codebase

The documentation follows standard Python docstring conventions (for backend) and JSDoc format (for frontend), maintaining consistency throughout the codebase.
