This controlled perturbation approach quantifies the degree to which protected characteristics influence model decisions, helping detect both direct discrimination and indirect bias through proxy variables even when sensitive attributes are not explicitly used as model inputs.",

This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, instead of predicting 'house price: £300,000', a prediction interval might say 'house price: £280,000 to £320,000 with 95% confidence'. This technique works by calculating upper and lower bounds that account for both model uncertainty (how confident the model is) and inherent randomness in the data.

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features.
