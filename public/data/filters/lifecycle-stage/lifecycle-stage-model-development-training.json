      "description": "An in-processing fairness technique that employs adversarial training with dual neural networks to learn fair representations. The method consists of a predictor network that learns the main task whilst an adversarial discriminator network simultaneously attempts to predict sensitive attributes from the predictor's hidden representations. Through this adversarial min-max game, the predictor is incentivised to learn features that are informative for the task but statistically independent of protected attributes, effectively removing bias at the representation level in deep learning models.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features. Practitioners can adjust a tuning parameter to balance between maintaining accuracy and removing prejudice from the model.",

The method addresses the challenge that fairness properties may not transfer when adapting models to new domains with different demographic compositions or data distributions. Fair transfer learning typically involves constraint-aware fine-tuning, domain adaptation techniques, or adversarial training that maintains equitable performance across groups in the target domain, ensuring that bias mitigation efforts carry over from source to target domains.",
