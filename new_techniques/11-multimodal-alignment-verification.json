  "name": "Multimodal Alignment Verification",
  "description": "Multimodal alignment verification ensures that different modalities (vision, language, audio) in multimodal AI systems are properly synchronized and consistent. This technique tests whether image descriptions match visual content, whether audio-visual models correctly associate sounds with visual sources, and whether cross-modal reasoning maintains factual accuracy. Verification includes adversarial testing with mismatched modalities, consistency checks across different modal representations, and evaluation of grounding quality when models reference specific regions or elements.",
