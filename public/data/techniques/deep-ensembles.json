  "description": "Deep ensembles combine predictions from multiple neural networks trained independently with different random initializations to capture epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty). By training several models on the same data with different starting points, the ensemble reveals how much the model's predictions depend on training randomness. The disagreement between ensemble members naturally indicates prediction uncertainty - when models agree, confidence is high; when they disagree, uncertainty is revealed. This approach provides more reliable uncertainty estimates, better out-of-distribution detection, and improved calibration compared to single models.",
