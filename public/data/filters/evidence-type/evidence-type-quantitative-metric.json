Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

It enhances detection by applying temperature scaling to soften the model's output distribution and adding small, carefully calibrated perturbations to the input that push in-distribution samples towards higher confidence predictions. By measuring the maximum softmax probability after these adjustments, ODIN can effectively distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs, flagging potentially unreliable predictions before they cause downstream errors.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",

      "description": "Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) measures model performance by plotting precision (the proportion of positive predictions that are correct) against recall (the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified) at various classification thresholds, then calculating the area under the resulting curve. Unlike accuracy or AUC-ROC, AUPRC is particularly valuable for imbalanced datasets where the minority class is of primary interest---a perfect score is 1.0, whilst random performance equals the positive class proportion. By focusing on the precision-recall trade-off, it provides a more informative assessment than overall accuracy for scenarios where false positives and false negatives have different costs, especially when positive examples are rare.",

This method modifies the training distribution by prioritising borderline objects (instances near decision boundaries) from underrepresented groups for duplication whilst potentially removing instances from overrepresented groups. Unlike relabelling approaches, preferential sampling maintains original class labels whilst creating a more balanced dataset that prevents models from learning biased patterns due to skewed group representation.",
