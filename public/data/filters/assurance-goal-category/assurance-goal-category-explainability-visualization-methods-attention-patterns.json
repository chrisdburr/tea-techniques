      "description": "Classical attention mechanisms in RNNs and CNNs create alignment matrices and temporal attention patterns that show how models focus on different input elements over time or space. This technique analyses these traditional attention patterns, particularly in encoder-decoder architectures and sequence-to-sequence models, where attention weights reveal which source elements influence each output step. Unlike transformer self-attention analysis, this focuses on understanding alignment patterns, temporal dependencies, and encoder-decoder attention dynamics in classical neural architectures.",

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",
