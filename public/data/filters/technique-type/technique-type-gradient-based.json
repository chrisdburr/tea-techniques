      "description": "Applies Integrated Gradients to natural language processing models to attribute prediction importance to individual input tokens, words, or subword units. This technique computes gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input (typically all-zeros, padding tokens, or neutral text) to the actual input, integrating these gradients to obtain attribution scores. Unlike vanilla gradient methods, Integrated Gradients satisfies axioms of sensitivity and implementation invariance, making it particularly valuable for understanding transformer-based language models where token interactions are complex.",
