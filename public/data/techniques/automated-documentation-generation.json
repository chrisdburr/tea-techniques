  "description": "Automated documentation generation creates and maintains up-to-date documentation using various methods including programmatic scripts, large language models (LLMs), and extraction tools. These approaches can capture model architectures, data schemas, feature importance, performance metrics, API specifications, and lineage information without manual writing. Methods range from traditional code parsing and template-based generation to modern AI-assisted documentation that can understand context and generate human-readable explanations.",
