  "name": "Internal Review Boards",
  "acronym": "IRBs",
  "description": "Internal Review Boards (IRBs) provide independent, systematic evaluation of AI/ML projects throughout their lifecycle to identify ethical, safety, and societal risks before they materialise. Typically composed of multidisciplinary experts including ethicists, domain specialists, legal counsel, community representatives, and technical staff, IRBs review project proposals, assess potential harms to individuals and communities, evaluate mitigation strategies, and establish ongoing monitoring requirements. Unlike traditional research ethics committees, AI-focused IRBs address algorithmic bias, fairness concerns, privacy implications, and societal impact at scale, providing essential governance for responsible AI development and deployment.",
