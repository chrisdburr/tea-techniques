  "acronym": null,
  "description": "A data generation technique that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create fair synthetic datasets by learning to generate data representations that preserve utility whilst obfuscating protected attributes. Unlike traditional GANs, Fairness GANs incorporate fairness constraints into the training objective, ensuring that the generated data maintains statistical parity across demographic groups. The technique can be used for data augmentation to balance underrepresented groups or to create privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that remove demographic bias from training data.",
