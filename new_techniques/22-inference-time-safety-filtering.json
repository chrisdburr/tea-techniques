  "name": "Inference-Time Safety Filtering",
  "description": "Inference-time safety filtering applies real-time content moderation during deployment, generating evidence of safety violations and filtering effectiveness. This technique produces detailed logs of blocked content, safety incident reports, violation pattern analysis, and filtering performance metrics. Evidence includes categorized threat taxonomies, false positive/negative rates, and temporal trends in attack patterns, supporting assurance claims about deployed system safety.",

      "description": "Implementing real-time filtering on a chatbot to catch any harmful outputs that slip through training-time safety alignment, blocking toxic content before it reaches users.",

    {
      "description": "Adds 50-200ms latency to inference depending on filter complexity, which may be unacceptable for real-time applications requiring sub-100ms response times."
