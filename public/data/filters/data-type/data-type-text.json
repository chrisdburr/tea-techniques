Unlike simpler attribution methods, it separates the direct contribution of specific words or phrases from the contextual effects of surrounding words. This is particularly useful for understanding how sequential models process language, as it can identify whether a word's influence comes from its individual meaning or from its interaction with nearby words in the sequence.",

      "description": "Applies Integrated Gradients to natural language processing models to attribute prediction importance to individual input tokens, words, or subword units. This technique computes gradients along a straight-line path from a baseline input (typically all-zeros, padding tokens, or neutral text) to the actual input, integrating these gradients to obtain attribution scores. Unlike vanilla gradient methods, Integrated Gradients satisfies axioms of sensitivity and implementation invariance, making it particularly valuable for understanding transformer-based language models where token interactions are complex.",

The technique visualises attention weights as heatmaps showing how strongly each token attends to every other token across different heads and layers. By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",
