  "description": "Runtime monitoring and circuit breakers establish continuous surveillance of AI/ML systems in production, tracking critical metrics such as prediction accuracy, response times, input characteristics, output distributions, and system resource usage. When monitored parameters exceed predefined safety thresholds or exhibit anomalous patterns, automated circuit breakers immediately trigger protective actions including request throttling, service degradation, system shutdown, or failover to backup mechanisms. This approach provides real-time defensive capabilities that prevent cascading failures, ensure consistent service reliability, and maintain transparent operation status for stakeholders monitoring system health.",
