      "description": "Causal mediation analysis in language models is a mechanistic interpretability technique that systematically investigates how specific internal components (neurons, attention heads, or layers) causally contribute to model outputs. By performing controlled interventions—such as activating, deactivating, or modifying specific components—researchers can trace the causal pathways through which information flows and transforms within the model. This approach goes beyond correlation to establish causal relationships, enabling researchers to understand not just what features influence outputs, but how and why they do so through specific computational pathways.",
