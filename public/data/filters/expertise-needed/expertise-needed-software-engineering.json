This distributed approach serves multiple purposes: preserving data privacy and sovereignty, reducing communication costs, enabling learning from diverse data sources, improving model robustness through heterogeneous training, and facilitating compliance with data protection regulations whilst maintaining model performance comparable to centralised training.",
