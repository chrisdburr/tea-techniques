It compares each neuron's activation to a reference activation (typically from a baseline input like all zeros or the dataset mean) and propagates these differences backwards through the network using chain rule modifications. Unlike gradient-based methods, DeepLIFT satisfies the sensitivity property (zero input gets zero attribution) and provides more stable attributions by using discrete differences rather than gradients.",

Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

      "description": "Neuron activation analysis examines the firing patterns of individual neurons in neural networks by probing them with diverse inputs and analysing their activation responses. This technique helps understand what concepts, features, or patterns different neurons have learned to recognise, providing insights into the model's internal representations. For large language models, this can reveal neurons specialised for linguistic concepts, semantic categories, or even potentially harmful patterns, enabling targeted interventions and deeper model understanding.",
