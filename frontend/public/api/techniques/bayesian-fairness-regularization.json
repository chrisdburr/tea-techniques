  "description": "Bayesian Fairness Regularization incorporates fairness constraints into machine learning models through Bayesian methods, treating fairness as a prior distribution or regularization term. This approach includes techniques like Fair Bayesian Optimization that use constrained optimization to tune model hyperparameters whilst enforcing fairness constraints, and methods that add regularization terms to objective functions to penalize discriminatory predictions. The technique allows for probabilistic interpretation of fairness constraints and can account for uncertainty in both model parameters and fairness requirements.",
