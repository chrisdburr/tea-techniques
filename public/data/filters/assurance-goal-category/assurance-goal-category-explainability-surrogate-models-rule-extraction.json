It searches for 'anchor' conditions (e.g., 'age > 30 AND income < £50k') that ensure the model gives the same prediction at least 95% of the time when those conditions are met. This creates human-readable rules that users can trust as sufficient conditions for understanding why a particular decision was made.",

It works by learning a sparse linear model that combines automatically extracted decision rules with original features. The technique first builds tree ensembles to generate candidate rules, then uses LASSO regression to select the most important rules and features. The resulting model provides global explanations through human-readable rules (e.g., 'IF age > 50 AND income < 30k THEN ...') combined with linear feature weights, making complex model behavior transparent and auditable.",
