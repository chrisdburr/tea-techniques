      "description": "Saliency maps are visual explanations for image classification models that highlight which pixels in an image most strongly influence the model's prediction. Computed by calculating gradients of the model's output with respect to input pixels, saliency maps produce heatmaps where brighter regions indicate pixels that, when changed, would most significantly affect the prediction. This technique helps users understand which parts of an image the model is 'looking at' when making decisions.",

Unlike pixel-level techniques, Grad-CAM produces coarser region-based explanations by using gradients from the predicted class to weight the CNN's final feature maps, then projecting these weighted activations back to create an overlay on the original image. This provides intuitive visual explanations of where the model is 'looking' for evidence of different classes.",
