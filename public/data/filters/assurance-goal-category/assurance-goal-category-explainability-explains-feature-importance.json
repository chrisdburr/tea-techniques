Each feature's effect is modelled separately as a smooth function, visualised as a curve showing how the feature influences predictions across its range. GAMs achieve this through spline functions or other smoothing techniques that capture complex patterns in individual variables without interactions, making them particularly valuable for domains requiring both predictive accuracy and model interpretability.",
