      "description": "An in-processing fairness technique that employs boosting algorithms to improve accuracy uniformly across demographic groups by iteratively correcting errors where the model performs poorly for certain subgroups. The method uses a multi-calibration approach that trains weak learners to focus on prediction errors for underperforming groups, ensuring that no group experiences systematically worse accuracy. This iterative boosting process continues until accuracy parity is achieved across all groups whilst maintaining overall model performance.",
