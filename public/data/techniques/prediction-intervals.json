  "description": "Prediction intervals provide a range of plausible values around a model's prediction, expressing uncertainty as 'the true value will likely fall between X and Y with Z% confidence'. For example, instead of predicting 'house price: £300,000', a prediction interval might say 'house price: £280,000 to £320,000 with 95% confidence'. This technique works by calculating upper and lower bounds that account for both model uncertainty (how confident the model is) and inherent randomness in the data. Prediction intervals are crucial for informed decision-making, as they help users understand the reliability and precision of predictions, enabling better risk assessment and planning.",
