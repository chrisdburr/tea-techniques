  "name": "Ridge Regression Surrogates",
  "description": "This technique approximates a complex model by training a ridge regression (a linear model with L2 regularization) on the original model's predictions. The ridge regression serves as a global surrogate that balances fidelity and interpretability, capturing the main linear relationships that the complex model learned while ignoring noise due to regularization.",
