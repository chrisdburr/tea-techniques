  "name": "Partial Dependence Plots",
  "description": "Partial Dependence Plots show how changing one or two features affects a model's predictions on average. The technique works by varying the selected feature(s) across their full range whilst keeping all other features fixed at their original values, then averaging the predictions. This creates a clear visualisation of whether increasing or decreasing a feature tends to increase or decrease predictions, and reveals patterns like linear trends, plateaus, or threshold effects that help explain model behaviour.",
