For example, instead of predicting 'house price: £300,000', a prediction interval might say 'house price: £280,000 to £320,000 with 95% confidence'. This technique works by calculating upper and lower bounds that account for both model uncertainty (how confident the model is) and inherent randomness in the data. Prediction intervals are crucial for informed decision-making, as they help users understand the reliability and precision of predictions, enabling better risk assessment and planning.",

When a model is too confident in its wrong answers, temperature scaling can fix this by making the predictions more realistic. It works by dividing the model's outputs by the temperature value before converting them to probabilities. Higher temperatures make the model less confident, whilst lower temperatures increase confidence. The technique maintains the model's accuracy whilst ensuring that when it says it's 90% confident, it's actually right about 90% of the time.",

By focusing on the precision-recall trade-off, it provides a more informative assessment than overall accuracy for scenarios where false positives and false negatives have different costs, especially when positive examples are rare.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features.
