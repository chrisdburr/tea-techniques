  "name": "Prompt Brittleness Testing",
  "description": "Prompt brittleness testing evaluates how sensitive model outputs are to minor variations in prompt wording, formatting, or structure. This technique systematically paraphrases prompts, reorders elements, changes formatting (capitalization, punctuation), and tests semantically equivalent variations to measure output consistency. Testing identifies brittle behaviors where superficial prompt changes cause dramatic performance swings, helping developers create robust prompt templates and understand model reliability boundaries.",
