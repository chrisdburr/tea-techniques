The algorithm converts similarities between data points into joint probabilities in the high-dimensional space, then tries to minimise the divergence between these probabilities and those in the low-dimensional embedding. This approach excels at revealing cluster structures and local patterns, making it particularly effective for exploratory data analysis and understanding complex data relationships that linear methods like PCA might miss.",

      "description": "Counterfactual Fairness Assessment evaluates whether a model's predictions would remain unchanged if an individual's protected attributes (race, gender, age) were different, whilst keeping all other causally legitimate factors constant. The technique requires constructing a causal graph that maps relationships between variables, then using do-calculus or structural causal models to simulate counterfactual scenarios. For example, it asks: 'Would this loan application still be approved if the applicant were a different race, holding constant their actual qualifications and economic circumstances?' This individual-level fairness criterion helps identify when decisions depend improperly on protected characteristics.",

This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",
