  "description": "Conformal prediction provides mathematically guaranteed uncertainty quantification by creating prediction sets that contain the true outcome with a specified probability (e.g., exactly 95% coverage). The technique works by measuring how 'strange' or 'nonconforming' new predictions are compared to calibration data - if a prediction seems unusual, it gets wider intervals. For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",
