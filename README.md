An interactive database for exploring techniques for evidencing claims about responsible AI design, development, and deployment. This repository has been designed to work in conjunction with the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/) as a core plugin to enable practitioners to identify and implement appropriate assurance methods.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **üìö Structured Documentation**: Each technique includes comprehensive information about its purpose, implementation details, and practical use cases.
-   **üóÇÔ∏è Categorized Organization**: Techniques are organized by assurance goals, categories, and subcategories to help you find exactly what you need.
-   **üîå API Access**: Access all data through a comprehensive REST API with documentation via Swagger.
-   **üß© Model Agnostic & Specific**: Browse techniques that work across different model types or that are designed for specific model architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

> [!WARNING]
> These instructions have only been tested on MacOS and Linux. If you are using Windows, you may need to adjust some commands.

<details>
<summary>ü™ß Prerequisites </summary>
  
- **Python 3.12+ & Poetry:** Install Python and then Poetry ([Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)).
- **Node.js 20+ & pnpm:** Install Node.js ([Download](https://nodejs.org/)) and then pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`).
- **PostgreSQL:** You need a running PostgreSQL server. 
   - **Installation:** If you don't have it, follow the official guide for your OS: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   - **Database Setup:** After installation, you need to create the database and user specified in your `.env` file. Connect to PostgreSQL (e.g., using `psql`) and run commands similar to these (adjust names/passwords if you changed them in `.env`):
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE techniques;
   CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres'; 
   ALTER ROLE postgres SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
   ALTER ROLE postgres SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
   ALTER ROLE postgres SET timezone TO 'UTC';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE techniques TO postgres;
   \q 
   ```

-   **Ensure it's running:** Make sure the PostgreSQL service is active before starting the backend.

<summary>üì¶ Local Development Setup</summary>

For local development, we use PostgreSQL as the database backend:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chrisdburr/tea-techniques.git
    cd tea-techniques
```

2. **Setup environment variable**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Important: Ensure the DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT variables in this .env file match your local PostgreSQL setup (see Prerequisites).

3. **Install and start PostgreSQL**

-   Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running locally (see Prerequisites).
-   Ensure the database and user specified in your .env file exist and the user has the correct password and permissions.

4. **Set up the backend**

```bash
cd backend
poetry install
# Ensure your .env file is configured correctly *before* running migrations/imports
python manage.py migrate # Apply database migrations
python manage.py reset_and_import_techniques # Reset and import data (use with caution if you have custom data)
# OR just import if DB exists: python manage.py import_techniques
```

5. **Run the backend**

```bash
# Make sure you are in the backend directory
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

6. **In a new terminal, set up and run the frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev:turbo
```

7. **Access the application**

-   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
-   API: http://localhost:8000/api/
-   Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/

</details>

<details>
<summary>üê≥ Docker Setup (Production-like Environment)</summary>

If you want to use the full Docker setup with PostgreSQL:

1. **Setup environment variable**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

-   You may want to review and adjust the values in the `.env` file (e.g. change user and password)

2. **Start the application**

    ```bash
    COMPOSE_BAKE=true docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. **Access the application**

-   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
-   API: http://localhost:8000/api/

4. **Restart and Rebuild the Containers**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down && COMPOSE_BAKE=true docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
    ```

## üì¶ Project Structure

-   **Backend**: Django with Django REST Framework

    -   `backend/api`: Main Django app
    -   `backend/config`: Django project settings
    -   `backend/scripts`: Utility scripts (e.g. reset DB, import CSV)
    -   `backend/data`: CSV file with technique data

-   **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
    -   `frontend/src/app`: Next.js pages and routes
    -   `frontend/src/components`: Reusable React components
    -   `frontend/src/lib`: Utilities, types, and API clients
