Using calculus and the implicit function theorem, they approximate this 'leave-one-out' effect without actually retraining the model by computing gradients and Hessian information. This mathematical approach reveals which specific training examples were most responsible for pushing the model toward or away from particular predictions, enabling practitioners to trace problematic outputs back to their root causes in the training data.",

The technique involves creating counterfactual instances by modifying potentially discriminatory features (race, gender, age) or their correlates (zip code, names, education institutions) and measuring the resulting prediction differences. This controlled perturbation approach quantifies the degree to which protected characteristics influence model decisions, helping detect both direct discrimination and indirect bias through proxy variables even when sensitive attributes are not explicitly used as model inputs.",

This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",

By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input. This provides insights into positional encoding effects, head specialisation patterns, and the evolution of attention from local to global context across layers.",

The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features. Practitioners can adjust a tuning parameter to balance between maintaining accuracy and removing prejudice from the model.",

Unlike general counterfactual fairness, this approach enables practitioners to identify and intervene on particular causal paths that may introduce bias whilst preserving other legitimate pathways. The method uses causal graphs to distinguish between direct discrimination (through protected attributes) and indirect discrimination (through seemingly neutral factors that correlate with protected attributes), allowing for more nuanced fairness assessments in complex causal settings.",
