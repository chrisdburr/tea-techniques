// Updated for MSW v2
// Note: There are module resolution issues with msw/node in the current setup
// This file is ready to be used once those issues are resolved

// import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'; - This import is causing issues
// import { handlers } from './handlers';

// Set up MSW server with our handlers
// export const server = setupServer(...handlers);

// Temporary placeholder to avoid import errors
export const server = {
  listen: () => console.log("Mock server would start"),
  resetHandlers: () => console.log("Mock handlers would reset"),
  close: () => console.log("Mock server would close"),
};
