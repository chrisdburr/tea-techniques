An interactive database for exploring techniques for evidencing claims about responsible AI design, development, and deployment. This repository has been designed to work in conjunction with the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/) as a core plugin to enable practitioners to identify and implement appropriate assurance methods.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **üìö Structured Documentation**: Each technique includes comprehensive information about its purpose, implementation details, and practical use cases.
- **üóÇÔ∏è Categorized Organization**: Techniques are organized by assurance goals, categories, and subcategories to help you find exactly what you need.
- **üîå API Access**: Access all data through a comprehensive REST API with documentation via Swagger.
- **üß© Model Agnostic & Specific**: Browse techniques that work across different model types or that are designed for specific model architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

> [!WARNING]
> These instructions have only been tested on MacOS and Linux. If you are using Windows, you may need to adjust some commands.

<details>
<summary>ü™ß Prerequisites </summary>

This project uses Poetry for Python dependency management. If you don't have Poetry installed:

```bash
# On Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# On Windows (PowerShell)
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
</details>

<summary>üì¶ Local Development Setup</summary>

For local development, we use PostgreSQL as the database backend:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrisdburr/tea-techniques.git
   cd tea-techniques
   ```

2. **Setup environment variable**

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  - You may want to review and adjust the values in the `.env` file (e.g. change database credentials)

3. **Install and start PostgreSQL**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system
   - Create a database named 'techniques' (or use the name specified in your .env file)

4. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry install
   python manage.py reset_and_import_techniques
   ```

5. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **In a new terminal, set up and run the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev:turbo
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - API: http://localhost:8000/api/
   - Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/

<summary>üê≥ Docker Setup (Production-like Environment)</summary>

If you want to use the full Docker setup with PostgreSQL:

1. **Setup environment variable**

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  - You may want to review and adjust the values in the `.env` file (e.g. change user and password)

2. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   COMPOSE_BAKE=true docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**

  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - API: http://localhost:8000/api/

4. **Restart and Rebuild the Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down && COMPOSE_BAKE=true docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üì¶ Project Structure

- **Backend**: Django with Django REST Framework
  - `backend/api`: Main Django app
  - `backend/config`: Django project settings
  - `backend/scripts`: Utility scripts (e.g. reset DB, import CSV)
  - `backend/data`: CSV file with technique data

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - `frontend/src/app`: Next.js pages and routes
  - `frontend/src/components`: Reusable React components
  - `frontend/src/lib`: Utilities, types, and API clients

## üí° Development Tips

1. **API Documentation**
   
   You can access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/swagger/ when the backend is running.
