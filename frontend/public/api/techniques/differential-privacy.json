  "description": "Differential privacy provides mathematically rigorous privacy protection by adding carefully calibrated random noise to data queries, statistical computations, or machine learning outputs. The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",
