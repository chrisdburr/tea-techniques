  "description": "Jackknife resampling (also called leave-one-out resampling) assesses model stability and uncertainty by systematically removing one data point at a time and retraining the model on the remaining data. Unlike bootstrapping which samples with replacement, jackknife creates n different models by excluding each of the n data points once. This systematic approach reveals how individual points influence results, provides robust estimates of prediction variance, and identifies unusually influential observations that may be outliers or leverage points affecting model reliability.",
