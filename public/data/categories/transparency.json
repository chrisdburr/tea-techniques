Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

The technique works by ensuring that the presence or absence of any individual's data has minimal impact on the results - specifically, any query result should be nearly indistinguishable whether or not a particular person's data is included. This is achieved through controlled noise addition that scales with the query's sensitivity and a privacy budget (epsilon) that quantifies the privacy-utility trade-off. The smaller the epsilon, the more noise is added and the stronger the privacy guarantee, but at the cost of reduced accuracy.",

The technique works by measuring how 'strange' or 'nonconforming' new predictions are compared to calibration data - if a prediction seems unusual, it gets wider intervals. For example, in medical diagnosis, instead of saying 'likely cancer', it might say 'possible diagnoses: {cancer, benign tumour} with 95% confidence'. This distribution-free method works with any underlying model (neural networks, random forests, etc.) and requires no assumptions about data distribution, making it a robust framework for reliable uncertainty estimates in high-stakes applications.",

By examining these attention patterns, practitioners can understand how models like BERT, GPT, and T5 build contextual representations, identify which tokens influence predictions most strongly, and detect potential biases in how the model processes different types of input.
