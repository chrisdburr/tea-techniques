## Task 2.2: Evaluate and Refactor Form Management

-   **Issue:** Custom `useForm` hook (`frontend/src/lib/hooks/useForm.ts`) adds complexity and might be replaceable by standard libraries. Validation seems minimal.
-   **Priority:** Medium
-   **Branch:** `refactor/frontend-form-hook`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **Evaluate Alternatives:** Research `react-hook-form` or `Formik` as potential replacements for `useForm`. Assess their suitability for the dynamic fields in `TechniqueForm.tsx` (Use Cases, Resources, Limitations).
    2.  **Decision:** Choose whether to refactor `useForm` for clarity/robustness or replace it.
    3.  **(If Replacing):**
        -   Install the chosen library (e.g., `pnpm add react-hook-form`).
        -   Refactor `TechniqueForm.tsx` to use the library's APIs for state, validation, and submission handling. Remove usage of the custom `useForm` hook.
        -   Integrate validation rules (potentially using a schema library like Zod).
    4.  **(If Refactoring `useForm`):**
        -   Improve validation logic within the hook or allow passing more complex validation schemas.
        -   Simplify state update logic where possible.
        -   Add comprehensive unit tests for the `useForm` hook itself.
-   **Considerations:** Replacing the hook is a significant refactor impacting `TechniqueForm.tsx`. Ensure the chosen library handles dynamic array fields well.
-   **Testing:** Add thorough unit tests for `useForm` (if refactoring) or integration tests for `TechniqueForm.tsx` validating state updates, validation, and submission (if replacing). Run linters.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large.
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task.
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything.
    -   Next, run code quality tools.
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`.
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch.

## Task Summary

The form management in the TEA Techniques application has been successfully refactored to replace the custom `useForm` hook with the industry-standard `react-hook-form` library. This refactoring included:

1. **Library Adoption**:
   - Added `react-hook-form` (v7.55.0) for form state management and validation
   - Added `zod` (v3.24.2) for schema validation
   - Added `@hookform/resolvers` (v4.1.3) to integrate Zod with react-hook-form

2. **Form Validation Improvements**:
   - Replaced custom validation functions with a comprehensive Zod schema
   - Validation now runs on blur and on submit, providing better user feedback
   - Error messages are properly typed and consistent throughout the form

3. **Component Refactoring**:
   - Replaced manual form state management with react-hook-form's `useForm` hook
   - Used `Controller` components for controlled inputs
   - Implemented field watching for dependent field relationships
   - Simplified form submission logic

4. **Testing**:
   - Added unit tests for the TechniqueForm component to verify functionality

5. **Benefits of the Refactoring**:
   - Reduced code complexity and improved maintainability
   - Better type safety throughout the form handling process
   - Improved validation with clear error messages
   - Follows industry best practices for React form management
   - Easier to extend with additional validation rules

The refactoring maintains all the existing functionality while providing a more robust foundation for future form enhancements.
