  "acronym": null,
  "description": "An in-processing fairness technique that adapts pre-trained models from one domain to another whilst explicitly preserving fairness constraints across different contexts or populations. The method addresses the challenge that fairness properties may not transfer when adapting models to new domains with different demographic compositions or data distributions. Fair transfer learning typically involves constraint-aware fine-tuning, domain adaptation techniques, or adversarial training that maintains equitable performance across groups in the target domain, ensuring that bias mitigation efforts carry over from source to target domains.",
