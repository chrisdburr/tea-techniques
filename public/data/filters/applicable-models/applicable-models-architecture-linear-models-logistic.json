      "description": "An in-processing fairness technique that adds a fairness penalty to machine learning models to reduce bias against protected groups. The method works by minimising 'mutual information' - essentially reducing how much the model's predictions reveal about sensitive attributes like race or gender. By adding this penalty term to the learning objective (typically in logistic regression), the technique ensures predictions become less dependent on protected features. This addresses not only direct discrimination but also indirect bias through correlated features. Practitioners can adjust a tuning parameter to balance between maintaining accuracy and removing prejudice from the model.",
