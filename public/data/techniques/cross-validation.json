  "description": "Cross-validation evaluates model performance and robustness by systematically partitioning data into multiple subsets (folds) and training/testing repeatedly on different combinations. Common approaches include k-fold (splitting into k equal parts), stratified (preserving class distributions), and leave-one-out variants. By testing on multiple independent holdout sets, it reveals how performance varies across different data subsamples, provides robust estimates of generalisation ability, and helps detect overfitting or model instability that single train-test splits might miss.",
