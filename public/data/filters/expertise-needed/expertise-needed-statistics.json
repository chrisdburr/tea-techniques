Unlike PCA which maximises total variance, factor analysis focuses on shared variance (communalities - the variance variables have in common) whilst separating out unique variance and measurement error. After extracting factors, rotation methods like varimax (which creates uncorrelated factors) or oblimin (allowing correlated factors) help make factors more interpretable by aligning them with distinct groups of variables.",

For example, instead of predicting 'house price: £300,000', a prediction interval might say 'house price: £280,000 to £320,000 with 95% confidence'. This technique works by calculating upper and lower bounds that account for both model uncertainty (how confident the model is) and inherent randomness in the data. Prediction intervals are crucial for informed decision-making, as they help users understand the reliability and precision of predictions, enabling better risk assessment and planning.",

When a model is too confident in its wrong answers, temperature scaling can fix this by making the predictions more realistic. It works by dividing the model's outputs by the temperature value before converting them to probabilities. Higher temperatures make the model less confident, whilst lower temperatures increase confidence. The technique maintains the model's accuracy whilst ensuring that when it says it's 90% confident, it's actually right about 90% of the time.",

By focusing on the precision-recall trade-off, it provides a more informative assessment than overall accuracy for scenarios where false positives and false negatives have different costs, especially when positive examples are rare.",

      "description": "A post-processing fairness technique based on Hardt et al.'s seminal work that adjusts classification thresholds after model training to achieve equal true positive rates and false positive rates across demographic groups. The method uses group-specific decision thresholds, potentially with randomisation, to satisfy the equalised odds constraint whilst preserving model utility. This approach enables fairness mitigation without retraining, making it applicable to existing deployed models or when training data access is restricted.",

This approach includes techniques like Fair Bayesian Optimization that use constrained optimization to tune model hyperparameters whilst enforcing fairness constraints, and methods that add regularization terms to objective functions to penalize discriminatory predictions. The technique allows for probabilistic interpretation of fairness constraints and can account for uncertainty in both model parameters and fairness requirements.",
