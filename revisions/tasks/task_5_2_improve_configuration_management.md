## Task 5.2: Improve Configuration Management Clarity

-   **Issue:** Database switching logic is mixed into `settings.py`. Docker build ARGs/ENVs are duplicated.
-   **Priority:** Low
-   **Branch:** `refactor/config-management`
-   **Steps:**
    1.  **(If Task 1.1 not fully done):** Implement separate Django settings files (e.g., `settings/base.py`, `settings/dev_pg.py`, `settings/dev_sqlite.py`, `settings/prod.py`) using a tool like `django-environ` or basic conditional imports based on `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`.
    2.  **Docker Frontend:** Simplify `frontend/Dockerfile`. Use `ARG` for build-time vars and `ENV` only for runtime vars needed _inside_ the container. Remove redundancy.
    3.  **Document Env Vars:** Ensure `.env.example` lists _all_ required environment variables for both backend and frontend, with clear explanations.
-   **Considerations:** Settings file refactoring requires updating `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and potentially test configurations.
-   **Testing:** Verify application runs correctly with different settings modules (if applicable). Test Docker builds and runtime behaviour.
-   **Important Instructions:**
    -   Create a new Git feature branch for this task before you make any changes
    -   Apply refactorings incrementally with frequent verification to keep functions from getting too complex, and files from becomign too large.
    -   If any task changes require edits to the project documentation (see `docs`), ensure these changes are carried out as part of this task.
    -   Once you think you have finished all steps, double-check them all to make sure you haven't missed anything.
    -   Next, run code quality tools.
    -   To finalise this task, add a summary of the change to this file. And, then update the status of the todo list in `plan.md`.
    -   Then, commit changes to the relevant feature branch.

## Task Completion Summary

The configuration management has been significantly improved with the following changes:

1. **Backend Django Settings Restructuring:**
   - Created a structured settings package with environment-specific settings files
   - Implemented specialized settings modules for different environments:
     - `settings/base.py` - Common settings for all environments
     - `settings/development.py` - Local development settings
     - `settings/production.py` - Production-specific settings with additional security
     - `settings/docker.py` - Docker-specific settings extending development
     - `settings/test.py` - Test-specific settings with in-memory SQLite database
     - `settings/sqlite.py` - Optional SQLite settings for local development
   - Updated `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, and `asgi.py` to use the new settings structure
   - Added environment-based detection for test settings

2. **Docker Configuration Improvements:**
   - Simplified the frontend Dockerfile by:
     - Using `ARG` only for build-time variables
     - Using `ENV` only for runtime variables
     - Removing redundant variable declarations
     - Improving comments for clarity
   - Updated backend Dockerfile with explicit default settings module
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to use the new settings structure
   - Added health check endpoint for more reliable container health monitoring

3. **Environment Variable Documentation:**
   - Created comprehensive `.env.example` files in:
     - Project root with all environment variables
     - Backend directory with backend-specific variables
     - Frontend directory with frontend-specific variables
   - Added clear documentation for each variable
   - Grouped variables by purpose and component

4. **Health Check Implementation:**
   - Added a dedicated health check endpoint at `/api/health/`
   - Implemented database connection verification
   - Updated Docker health check configuration to use the new endpoint

5. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated `DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md` with the new settings structure
   - Added environment variable documentation for each component
   - Updated troubleshooting section with settings-related guidance

These changes have significantly improved the configuration management of the application, making it more maintainable, easier to deploy in different environments, and better documented for developers.
