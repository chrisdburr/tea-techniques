  "description": "Synthetic data generation creates artificial datasets that aim to preserve the statistical properties, distributions, and relationships of real data whilst containing no actual records from real individuals. The technique encompasses various approaches including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), statistical sampling methods, and privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy. Beyond privacy protection, synthetic data serves multiple purposes: augmenting limited datasets, balancing class distributions, testing model robustness, enabling data sharing across organisations, and supporting fairness assessments by generating representative samples for underrepresented groups.",
