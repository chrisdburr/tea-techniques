  "name": "Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards",
  "description": "Human-in-the-loop safeguards establish systematic checkpoints where human experts review, validate, or override AI/ML system decisions before they take effect. This governance approach combines automated efficiency with human judgement by defining clear intervention criteria (such as uncertainty thresholds, risk levels, or sensitive contexts) that trigger mandatory human oversight. By incorporating domain expertise, ethical considerations, and contextual understanding that machines may lack, these safeguards help ensure that critical decisions maintain appropriate human accountability whilst preserving the benefits of automated processing for routine cases.",
