  "name": "Agent Goal Misalignment Testing",
  "description": "Agent goal misalignment testing identifies scenarios where AI agents pursue objectives in unintended ways or develop proxy goals that diverge from true human intent. This technique tests for specification gaming (achieving stated metrics while violating intent), instrumental goals (agents developing problematic sub-goals to achieve main objectives), and reward hacking (exploiting loopholes in reward functions). Testing uses diverse scenarios to probe whether agents truly understand task intent or merely optimize narrow specified metrics.",
