  "description": "Prototype and Criticism Models provide data understanding by identifying two complementary sets of examples: prototypes represent the most typical instances that best summarise common patterns in the data, whilst criticisms are outliers or edge cases that are poorly represented by the prototypes. For example, in a dataset of customer transactions, prototypes might be the most representative buying patterns (frequent small purchases, occasional large purchases), whilst criticisms could be unusual behaviors (bulk buyers, one-time high-value customers). This dual approach reveals both what is normal and what is exceptional, helping understand data coverage and model blind spots.",
